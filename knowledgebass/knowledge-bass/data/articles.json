      "title": "Does the 120º dispersion of the DV12 cause interference or comb filtering if the speakers are too close together?",
      "content": "Q: What is the minimum width the DV12 speakers should be distanced from one another, and will being too close cause interference? A: The minimum width between a left and a right speaker is, in effect, the width between two ears, like headphones. The next point about minimum distance is about how many people can listen to both speakers. If the speakers are too close together, very few people will be able to experience “stereo”. People to the left of the left speaker and people to the right of the right speaker won’t get much benefit from the use of 2 speakers. Comb filtering is another issue altogether, and the issue isn’t really applicable to stereo pairs. Comb filtering does occur with stereo pairs but it’s less noticeable because the brain isn’t processing the two inputs trying to determine what frequencies are missing. Specifically, different frequencies are missing from the input to each ear, so the other ear can fill in the blanks. Comb filtering occurs when there are two sources of the same information, but stereo sources do not contain exactly the same information, and our brains process the information differently. The information contained in the sound arriving first at the left ear and then at the right ear is compared to the information arriving first at the right ear and then at the left ear. If there is no difference between the two sets of information, the brain cannot determine location, and so the location is assumed to be center. If the listener is closer to one side than the other, more, if not most, elements will seem to be arriving from the nearer side. Comb filtering is worst, aka most noticeable, when two adjacent sources are producing identical output. In the absence of another, different or more distant source, the brain is able to recognize when frequencies drop out because they drop out dramatically, not slightly, and often they drop out from both ears. Back to the point, as long as the two speakers are on opposite sides of your head, and playing different (aka stereo) signals, comb filtering is not going to be a noticeable issue. Comb filtering becomes an issue when two speakers are playing the same signal and are at different distances from only one of your ears, aka on the same side of your head, (or one measurement microphone.) The nulled frequency is more completely nulled if the difference in level is minimal, which is the case when the two speakers are very close together. The nulled frequency is a function of the wavelength as compared to the difference in distance from one source to the other. The null will occur where one source is farther from the listener by half the wavelength of that frequency. The short version: Use one left speaker and one right speaker and try to fit the audience between them. The coverage angles are largely irrelevant in this scenario. The coverage angles and their effect on comb filtering are of greatest concern when arraying multiple speakers. The attached PDF shows two speakers 5 meters apart. The sound fields intersect 1.4 meters in front of the mid point between the speakers. (About 4.5 feet). Narrower coverage will move that point farther away, but is that desirable? Moving the speakers closer together will move that point closer. With cabinets 3 meters apart, the intersection point is about 1 meter in front of the cabinets. Having the speakers less than 10 feet apart isn’t a problem, it just moves the intersection point closer. If the worry is about feedback, the idea is that the mics should be behind the speakers.",

Even doubly compress 320s are going to greatly suffer in the sound quality and dynamics department. Best practice is to export to WAV to avoid a second layer of compression. As for the best practice on gear setup: - If only one set of XLRs is dispatched to the system, hit the BASSBOSS subs first and the next manufacturer / tops second. - You have a second output available, run the tops on one set of XLRs and the subs on the other.

      "title": "Why are the frequency responses lower for pairs of subwoofers than single subs?",
      "content": "If you have a loudspeaker that’s operating at its bottom limit, and then you supply another box to assist that first box, collectively their bottom limit extends lower. That effect is true for any subwoofer and subwoofer pair. When you put multiple boxes together, the low-frequency corner does shift down slightly. It’s the same principle that allows multiple horns to extend lower than individual horns. It’s a ratio of frontal area to wavelength. There is also a slight increase in directivity that affords a slight increase in the measured output at the lowest frequencies. The effect is much more noticeable with horns because most of the time their frontal area is way too small to make them efficient at those lowest frequencies, so multiple horns are required to achieve the intended frequency response if that response extends below the wavelength represented by the perimeter of the frontal radiating area of a single horn. There is another principle involved. It can best be understood as being similar to boundary loading. When you have a box operating in free space versus half space versus quarter space versus eighth space the box in question will measure higher SPL at the same distance from the source in each environment. This is because you constrain the radiation of that energy. There is, however, an additional effect. There is a very slight change in their resonance due to the constraint of the boundary. Similarly, an adjacent loudspeaker acts as a boundary constraint but it also contributes energy into the same space, and that energy is pressure. Both loudspeakers are now contributing pressure into the space and, if their wavelengths and time relationship overlap, they are effectively pushing into a higher pressure environment collectively, and individually, than if they were each operating alone. This shifts the resonance of the system down ever so slightly, which contributes to the low-frequency extension of the vented enclosure via a second mechanism.",

      "content": "Yes, you can daisy chain as many speakers as you want regarding signal, as that is simply a passthrough connection. It's recommended to daisy chain per channel, start with subs, and move to tops at the end. This is primarily for cable management reasons and not because it affects the signal. For daisy chaining power Quick answer: Connect subs directly to outlets. Use power passthrough for tops if needed. Long answer: Every outlet has a maximum rated current. Every connector has a maximum rated current. Every breaker has a maximum rated current. The most that can be drawn down a single daisy-chain is limited by the item with the lowest rating. In the USA that's usually a 15A outlet or plug. In each owner's manual, the \"average\" current draw is listed for each product at 120V or at 240V. Based on the voltage you're using, (120V is the norm in the USA) add up the ratings for each speaker you intend to connect and stop when you reach the total of the lowest rated connection. (15A using the standard 120V power cords.) In general, subwoofers draw closer to their rated current than tops. Tops often draw a very small fraction of their rated current. This fact leads to some practical choices: Always connect subwoofers directly to outlets and daisy-chain to tops last. If power is limited, always account for all the current required for subs first, distributing the subs over as many circuits and outlets as possible. Power for tops can be shared with subs with less concern for reaching the limits of the connectors than if subs are connected together. For those who argue that amps can't put out more power than they draw in, here is the expanded scope: Each amp has a \"rated\" maximum power output. This specification is related to the maximum SPL the speaker can achieve but isn't directly related to the current draw under normal circumstances. What are normal circumstances? Each amplifier has a \"rated\" power draw that is lower than the \"rated\" power output. This is because audio has dynamic range and the average density of music content is about 12%. Thus the average current required to run an amplifier that plays music is about 1/8 the current required to deliver maximum SPL.

      "title": "Can I use BASSBOSS subwoofers with turntables?",
      "content": "When turntables are used in conjunction with powerful subwoofers, significant steps need to be taken to stabilize and isolate the turntables. In the more recent decades, turntables have been largely replaced with digital media. This is because the bass demanded in modern music can't be recorded into or played back from vinyl records. The more bass there is in the music, and the more bass there is in the system, the more problematic turntables become. Turntables operate on a fundamentally different principle from magnetic (ie tape) and digital media storage and playback mechanisms. Digital and magnetic media sources are totally isolated from the environment in which they are used. Unfortunately, that's very definitely not the case when it comes to turntables. Back to the stone age: A turntable pickup needle is a stone, usually a tiny industrial diamond, glued to the end of a tiny rod. On the other end of that rod is a tiny magnet inside a tiny coil. Moving the \"needle\" moves the rod, and the rod moves the magnet, which then produces a tiny electrical signal from the tiny coil. This tiny signal is amplified by the turntable. It is then amplified again by the phono preamps. It is then amplified again by the mixer. It is then amplified again by the power amplifiers. (When turntables were commonly in use, amplifiers were much less powerful.) There are several points to note from this. 1) The signal coming from the turntable needle is amplified by many orders of magnitude. 2) The signal is produced by physical vibrations. 3) Sound is also physical vibrations, so the output of the subwoofers can be picked up by the needle and re-amplified. 4) When the subwoofers are close to the turntables, there is a greater chance of this happening, which is one reason why I recommended moving the subs to the corner of the room, away from the DJ stand. Drop the needle on the record: That stone is dropped into the groove of a vinyl record, the sides of which have textures pressed into them such that when the vinyl is scraped over the surface of the diamond, it moves microscopic distances back and forth at exactly the frequencies (notes) and intensities (volume) that are intended to be reproduced. These tiny movements move the magnet at the other end of the rod and those movements are precisely amplified to reproduce the music recorded on the vinyl. There are important points to consider here: 1) If the needle moves at all, by any cause, that movement will create a signal, and that signal will be picked up and amplified by each subsequent step in the signal chain. 2) If the turntable, the turntable stand, the stage floor or the hand touching the record moves, that needle moves, and a signal is produced. 3) These movements happen at very low frequencies, below the frequencies that humans can hear and below the frequencies at which speakers can safely operate. 4) These movements are inevitably much larger in scale than the tiny movements that turntable needles are intended to encounter, so the effect is that the signal produced by these unintentional movements is far, far bigger and more powerful than anything that could be recorded onto the record(s). Within the speakers, limiters are implemented to prevent over-powering the woofers under normal circumstances. In addition, frequencies below their normal operating ranges are filtered out. With tops boxes, the filters are high enough to keep the woofers in them out of trouble from these issues. This is one of the reasons it's possible to determine that the source of the problems with your system are related to out-of-control signals at extremely low frequencies. Even in the subwoofers, the very lowest frequencies are filtered out of the signal being fed to the woofers, but a balance has to be struck between providing plentiful low-frequency output and preventing every conceivable form of damage. If subwoofers didn't produce any deep bass, they wouldn't be subwoofers. (They definitely wouldn't be BASSBOSS subwoofers!) Vented (ported) loudspeakers can produce decent levels of low-frequency energy down to what's referred to as the resonance frequency of their ports. Down to those frequencies, the resonance of the port does two things. One, it provides acoustical output, and two, it modulates (restricts) the movement of the cone. Below the resonance frequency of the system, the port is no longer restricting the movement of the cone. As the frequencies move well below resonance, the port begins working against the amplifier's control over the cone. When a powerful signal that is well below resonance is put into a ported system, it is possible for the woofer to move too far, damaging its suspension and/or its voice coil. The filters that are used to reduce low-frequency output are best described as having a \"slope\" insofar as they reduce the level of frequencies below a chosen frequency more and more the farther the signal goes below that chosen frequency. These filter slopes are described in terms of \"decibels per octave\" with an octave representing the range over which a frequency halves or doubles. (40Hz to 80Hz is an octave. 60Hz to 30Hz is an octave. 500Hz to 1000Hz is an octave, etc.) To put it in specific terms, the filter frequency in the DJ18 is 30Hz and the slope is 24 decibels per octave. If the subwoofer receives a signal at any frequency below 80Hz and above 30Hz, it passes the signal through to the amplifier unchanged. If it receives a signal at 15Hz, one octave below the filter frequency, it reduces the level by 24 decibels before passing it through to the amplifier. When music program is the source, this is sufficient to protect the woofer because there is no music content at 15Hz and the levels are consistent within the recording. However, if a signal comes in at 15Hz that is 24dB higher than the music level signal would be at 30Hz, the two signals would reach the woofer at the same level. If the woofer is driven by a signal at 15Hz anywhere near as hard as it would be at 30Hz and above, even occasionally, damage will result. Similarly, at 22Hz, the signal is lowered by 12dB, so a signal at 22Hz that was 12dB louder than the normal signal from a record or digital file would push the driver beyond its limits. We do our best to protect the speakers from every circumstance that may be anticipated to put them in danger, even well beyond \"normal\" but excessive movement and infrasonic feedback caused by unstable turntables is beyond the scope of the protection required by the vast majority of customers. This protection can be implemented but it's necessary for the customer to understand the dangers and limitations associated with implementing old technologies with new and powerful systems. When turntables were the primary source of music in clubs, bass was weak and DJs had booths to isolate the turntables from the speakers on the dance floor. What can be done to protect high-powered, deep-bass subwoofers from turntables? The first, best, easiest and cheapest answer is to keep turntables out of the building. If you do plan to use turntables regularly, it's best to go old-school and build an absolutely, solid immovable platform for the turntables. This is best done starting from a concrete floor and building the platform from concrete and/or cinderblocks and concrete. When the turntable stand is concrete and anchored to the floor with rebar or all-thread so that you can stomp-kick the turntable stand without skipping a playing record, you've got a good turntable stand. No part of the stage, railings or anything at all can be allowed to touch the turntable stand. In addition, some of the deepest bass would still need to be filtered out. If you must use turntables, and you won't be building the above turntable stand, you have to give up on the deep bass. This isn't such a big compromise as it sounds because records can't store or reproduce deep bass. Essentially, if you're using records, you're not getting deep bass anyway, and you definitely can't access any of what they do have without the aforementioned turntable stand. If you want to keep deep-bass capabilities available in your system when turntables are not in use, the deep bass must be filtered out when turntables are in use. This requires additional equipment between the DJ mixer and the speakers, into which the appropriate filters can be programmed. A \"Turntables\" setting would need to be loaded any time turntables were going to be in use. The MK3 line has these preset settings available in all subwoofer models. To further reduce the possibility of problems, the subwoofers must be positioned and/or programmed so that a bass-null is created in the area of the turntable stand. Relocating the subwoofers is beneficial in achieving this.",

      "htmlContent": "<p class=\"text-gray-300\">When turntables are used in conjunction with powerful subwoofers, significant steps need to be taken to stabilize and isolate the turntables. In the more recent decades, turntables have been largely replaced with digital media. This is because the bass demanded in modern music can't be recorded into or played back from vinyl records. The more bass there is in the music, and the more bass there is in the system, the more problematic turntables become. Turntables operate on a fundamentally different principle from magnetic (ie tape) and digital media storage and playback mechanisms. Digital and magnetic media sources are totally isolated from the environment in which they are used. Unfortunately, that's very definitely not the case when it comes to turntables. Back to the stone age: A turntable pickup needle is a stone, usually a tiny industrial diamond, glued to the end of a tiny rod. On the other end of that rod is a tiny magnet inside a tiny coil. Moving the \"needle\" moves the rod, and the rod moves the magnet, which then produces a tiny electrical signal from the tiny coil. This tiny signal is amplified by the turntable. It is then amplified again by the phono preamps. It is then amplified again by the mixer. It is then amplified again by the power amplifiers. (When turntables were commonly in use, amplifiers were much less powerful.) There are several points to note from this. 1) The signal coming from the turntable needle is amplified by many orders of magnitude. 2) The signal is produced by physical vibrations. 3) Sound is also physical vibrations, so the output of the subwoofers can be picked up by the needle and re-amplified. 4) When the subwoofers are close to the turntables, there is a greater chance of this happening, which is one reason why I recommended moving the subs to the corner of the room, away from the DJ stand. Drop the needle on the record: That stone is dropped into the groove of a vinyl record, the sides of which have textures pressed into them such that when the vinyl is scraped over the surface of the diamond, it moves microscopic distances back and forth at exactly the frequencies (notes) and intensities (volume) that are intended to be reproduced. These tiny movements move the magnet at the other end of the rod and those movements are precisely amplified to reproduce the music recorded on the vinyl. There are important points to consider here: 1) If the needle moves at all, by any cause, that movement will create a signal, and that signal will be picked up and amplified by each subsequent step in the signal chain. 2) If the turntable, the turntable stand, the stage floor or the hand touching the record moves, that needle moves, and a signal is produced. 3) These movements happen at very low frequencies, below the frequencies that humans can hear and below the frequencies at which speakers can safely operate. 4) These movements are inevitably much larger in scale than the tiny movements that turntable needles are intended to encounter, so the effect is that the signal produced by these unintentional movements is far, far bigger and more powerful than anything that could be recorded onto the record(s). Within the speakers, limiters are implemented to prevent over-powering the woofers under normal circumstances. In addition, frequencies below their normal operating ranges are filtered out. With tops boxes, the filters are high enough to keep the woofers in them out of trouble from these issues. This is one of the reasons it's possible to determine that the source of the problems with your system are related to out-of-control signals at extremely low frequencies. Even in the subwoofers, the very lowest frequencies are filtered out of the signal being fed to the woofers, but a balance has to be struck between providing plentiful low-frequency output and preventing every conceivable form of damage. If subwoofers didn't produce any deep bass, they wouldn't be subwoofers. (They definitely wouldn't be BASSBOSS subwoofers!) Vented (ported) loudspeakers can produce decent levels of low-frequency energy down to what's referred to as the resonance frequency of their ports. Down to those frequencies, the resonance of the port does two things. One, it provides acoustical output, and two, it modulates (restricts) the movement of the cone. Below the resonance frequency of the system, the port is no longer restricting the movement of the cone. As the frequencies move well below resonance, the port begins working against the amplifier's control over the cone. When a powerful signal that is well below resonance is put into a ported system, it is possible for the woofer to move too far, damaging its suspension and/or its voice coil. The filters that are used to reduce low-frequency output are best described as having a \"slope\" insofar as they reduce the level of frequencies below a chosen frequency more and more the farther the signal goes below that chosen frequency. These filter slopes are described in terms of \"decibels per octave\" with an octave representing the range over which a frequency halves or doubles. (40Hz to 80Hz is an octave. 60Hz to 30Hz is an octave. 500Hz to 1000Hz is an octave, etc.) To put it in specific terms, the filter frequency in the DJ18 is 30Hz and the slope is 24 decibels per octave. If the subwoofer receives a signal at any frequency below 80Hz and above 30Hz, it passes the signal through to the amplifier unchanged. If it receives a signal at 15Hz, one octave below the filter frequency, it reduces the level by 24 decibels before passing it through to the amplifier. When music program is the source, this is sufficient to protect the woofer because there is no music content at 15Hz and the levels are consistent within the recording. However, if a signal comes in at 15Hz that is 24dB higher than the music level signal would be at 30Hz, the two signals would reach the woofer at the same level. If the woofer is driven by a signal at 15Hz anywhere near as hard as it would be at 30Hz and above, even occasionally, damage will result. Similarly, at 22Hz, the signal is lowered by 12dB, so a signal at 22Hz that was 12dB louder than the normal signal from a record or digital file would push the driver beyond its limits. We do our best to protect the speakers from every circumstance that may be anticipated to put them in danger, even well beyond \"normal\" but excessive movement and infrasonic feedback caused by unstable turntables is beyond the scope of the protection required by the vast majority of customers. This protection can be implemented but it's necessary for the customer to understand the dangers and limitations associated with implementing old technologies with new and powerful systems. When turntables were the primary source of music in clubs, bass was weak and DJs had booths to isolate the turntables from the speakers on the dance floor. What can be done to protect high-powered, deep-bass subwoofers from turntables? The first, best, easiest and cheapest answer is to keep turntables out of the building. If you do plan to use turntables regularly, it's best to go old-school and build an absolutely, solid immovable platform for the turntables. This is best done starting from a concrete floor and building the platform from concrete and/or cinderblocks and concrete. When the turntable stand is concrete and anchored to the floor with rebar or all-thread so that you can stomp-kick the turntable stand without skipping a playing record, you've got a good turntable stand. No part of the stage, railings or anything at all can be allowed to touch the turntable stand. In addition, some of the deepest bass would still need to be filtered out. If you must use turntables, and you won't be building the above turntable stand, you have to give up on the deep bass. This isn't such a big compromise as it sounds because records can't store or reproduce deep bass. Essentially, if you're using records, you're not getting deep bass anyway, and you definitely can't access any of what they do have without the aforementioned turntable stand. If you want to keep deep-bass capabilities available in your system when turntables are not in use, the deep bass must be filtered out when turntables are in use. This requires additional equipment between the DJ mixer and the speakers, into which the appropriate filters can be programmed. A \"Turntables\" setting would need to be loaded any time turntables were going to be in use. The <strong class=\"text-white\">MK3</strong> line has these preset settings available in all subwoofer models. To further reduce the possibility of problems, the subwoofers must be positioned and/or programmed so that a bass-null is created in the area of the turntable stand. Relocating the subwoofers is beneficial in achieving this.</p>"

      "content": "Q: I own the zv28 mk1 and am looking at the newer version. The specs on max SPL are listed as a few different values depending where you look but the MK3 says 137 db when the MK1 said 142 db max SPL. Has this changed? If so, why? A: I always resisted making claims about \"peak\" output, but when our gear was being added to websites like Guitar Center and Sweetwater, they had text fields that needed to be filled with those numbers. All the peak numbers I'd seen published by \"the competition\" were unrealistic. They were numbers based on calculations, not measurements. The trouble was, if we published measured output, it would seem that our speakers were nowhere near as loud as \"the competition\", and we heard plenty of questions about why our boxes were not as loud as but more expensive than \"Model ABC\". The truth is that they were easily as loud, if not significantly louder, but we provided SPL figures that were measured with crossovers on and limiters engaged, exactly as the boxes were delivered to the customers. Other companies would publish SPL figures that could only be achieved outside of the subwooofer operating band. Even worse, most published SPL figures based on calculations using the sensitivity of the drivers and the theoretical maximum output of the amplifiers. These claims were impossible to realize because they didn't take into account the excursion or thermal limits of the drivers, nor the fact that the amplifiers often were similarly over-specified. In other words, they were the \"WLS\" numbers. When Lightning Strikes, and you have access to that 1.21 gigawatts, this might happen... Nevertheless, we needed to provide some point of comparison for all those web shoppers who weren't going to read the kind of long and involved explanation provided above. So we compromised and included a \"Peak SPL\" figure that was directly comparable to the numbers supplied by \"the competition\" and added an asterisk that led to a short version of the explanation above. Here's what it said: *Peak output is calculated using “industry standard” techniques. These calculation methods create theoretical specifications that are inflated over what can actually be achieved. BASSBOSS real world output specifications are provided as “Maximum Sustained Output” ratings, which reflect actual measured, continuous output levels. As I said, I never liked publishing those numbers, even with that disclaimer, and since the speakers were now more widely available, the reputation better known and, probably most significantly, they were being delivered and demonstrated to the salespeople by our new distributor, the question about SPL was readily put to rest with in-person experiences. For the reasons above, when the time came to produce the new specifications for the Mk3, we decided to eliminate the \"calculated\" peak output specifications. As a final note, although the amps have changed, you'll see that the continuous output SPL has not. This is because the output SPL is constrained by the excursion and thermal limitations of the drivers, not the amps. The really noticeable improvements between MK1 and MK3 are in the ports, which are bigger and longer and less restrictive, allowing higher SPL at lower frequencies. This doesn't improve peak SPL, but it improves how much SPL is available in the 23 to 36Hz range. (If you like that sort of thing...) Thanks and best regards, David Lee",

      "content": "Q: I took out my subs and as the night went on I heard it hit less and less does that mean that it will compress and lower in volume? It def wasn‚'t hitting as hard as the beginning. The short answer to your question is no. The processing will not compress and lower the volume as the event goes on. But, like so many other things in sound systems and acoustics, there's never only a short answer... There are plenty of other things that could contribute to that perception. The relative output of tops versus subs. If you start out with the blend of subwoofer and tops levels to your liking at lower volumes, and then increase the volume as the night goes on, it may be that your subwoofers will begin limiting before your tops do. People tend to want 6 to 12dB more SPL at subwoofer frequencies than at tweeter or midrange frequencies. Sensitivities remaining equal, every octave lower in frequency requires 4x the power to produce the same SPL. In other words, it takes 4x more power to produce 110dB at 60Hz than it does to produce 110dB at 120Hz. If it took 100 Watts to produce 110dB at 120Hz, it would take 400 Watts to produce 110dB at 60Hz and it would take 1600 Watts to produce 110dB at 30Hz. Add to that the fact that people want or expect 6 to 12dB more SPL at subwoofer frequencies, which requires doubling the power for each 3dB, and you get to a demand for 12,800W to achieve 122dB at 30Hz in our hypothetical simulation. The usual result is that the subwoofers tend to limit themselves for self-preservation purposes long before the tops need to, and the perception is that the subs lose impact, when in fact they don't, it's just that the tops have an easier time achieving higher SPLs. The next factor is called \"thermal compression\". As power is passed through a voice coil, the temperature of the coil rises. The rise in temperature causes a rise in resistance/impedance. With that increase in resistance, even though the amplifier is putting out the same voltage, the total power passing through the coil is reduced. The resulting output is therefore also reduced. The safe extent of thermal compression tends to be below 2dB, so the limiting is set to prevent temperature increases that would result in more than 2dB of thermal compression. Another thing that could create the impression of a lowering of level is the increase in people, who tend to soak up sound. A third factor is adrenaline. You're less sensitive when you're excited. A fourth factor could be the increased demand on the electrical system in the building, from ACs, refrigerators, lights, or ice machines. And finally, the most universal effect that causes a perceived reduction of level is temporary threshold shift. Your ears just get used to the increased stimulation and become numb to it. You can verify all these effects using a Z-weighted SPL measurement. (For clarification, A-weighting measures SPL essentially above 1000Hz, C-weighting measures SPL above 100Hz, and Z (zero) weighting measures SPL from 8Hz and above. In other words, you need a Z-weighted meter in order to measure the output of subwoofers.)",

The safe extent of thermal compression tends to be below 2dB, so the limiting is set to prevent temperature increases that would result in more than 2dB of thermal compression. Another thing that could create the impression of a lowering of level is the increase in people, who tend to soak up sound. A third factor is adrenaline. You're less sensitive when you're excited. A fourth factor could be the increased demand on the electrical system in the building, from ACs, refrigerators, lights, or ice machines. And finally, the most universal effect that causes a perceived reduction of level is temporary threshold shift. Your ears just get used to the increased stimulation and become numb to it. You can verify all these effects using a Z-weighted SPL measurement. (For clarification, A-weighting measures SPL essentially above 1000Hz, C-weighting measures SPL above 100Hz, and Z (zero) weighting measures SPL from 8Hz and above. In other words, you need a Z-weighted meter in order to measure the output of subwoofers.)</p>"

      "content": "This article contains some tips and tricks for getting the best performance out of your BASSBOSS loudspeakers Input Sensitivity: The input sensitivity on the MK3 line of speakers is lower than what many are used to - this was a deliberate choice to maximize signal-to-noise ratio and try to give you the best sound possible. The standard for professional audio equipment is +24dBu, which will be well into the maximum output of the subwoofer, but we've found some customers are using gear that cannot reach this level (or they are not comfortable/used to pushing their mixer where it outputs that level). If you are already using a mixer that provides auxiliary outputs or sends, having your subwoofer(s) on a separate send is a good solution, but it isn't necessary. Our recommendation is to set up your audio so it goes into your subwoofer(s) and then jumps from your subwoofer(s) into your tops. We recommend turning the volume knob on the back of the sub all the way up, and starting with your tops all the way down. Then turn up the volume of your tops until you find a balance of sub/top that you like. Once you've found this point, you can keep the volume levels in that position from gig to gig and adjust as needed. If your mixer is capable of sending a hotter signal, chances are you'll get better sound out of it. If you are using gear (like a mixer or DJ controller) that isn't able to drive the sub to maximum output, let us know and we can always create a firmware file that is more sensitive/increases the input sensitivity on the box so you don't have to push it as much. New firmware will be available soon that also increases the input sensitivity. Power Conditioning and Surge Protection Our recommendation is not to use any power conditioning/voltage regulators for your subwoofers (though many people do run their gear through a power conditioner without issue). There are two reasons: The first is there are times the subwoofer, when running near or at maximum output, will draw more power (and thus current) for big transients (think drum hits and bass drops). It is momentary enough not to trip a breaker but a power conditioner may clip the available power. It is unlikely the conditioner itself will trip, but it can \"clip\" and limit the available power, which keeps the sub from hitting as hard. The second is that there have been 1-2 customers who have had issues with the volume coming down when using power conditioners and surge protectors. It is often better to try and avoid anything that could potentially limit the available power when using things that can draw a lot of power (like our subwoofers) If you need/want to use a power conditioner for other equipment, our recommendation is to use the power conditioner or surge protector for the gear that needs it (sometimes people prefer to use a power conditioner with DJ equipment or mixers) and run your BASSBOSS speakers (especially subwoofers) from the wall or a splitter directly. Avoid GFCI outlets whenever possible, as these are prone to trip when there are transient peaks.",

In the blizzard of hyperbole it is difficult to know what to believe. Many of the speakers on the market are \"paper tigers\", with performance numbers that can be achieved for mere milliseconds, if at all. This is at its worst with subwoofers. Sensitivity and peak output numbers are quoted at frequencies well outside the operational band anyone would or should use a subwoofer. Frequency response is quoted for speakers with bass-boosted EQ. Sometimes you can find the truth in the fine print, but OFTEN not. Claiming a peak output of 137dB looks great on paper but at what frequency can the quoted speaker do 137 dB, and for how long? Can the speaker also do 137 dB at any other frequency, let alone the frequency claimed to be the low frequency corner? Technically a loudspeaker that claims to have a peak output of 137dB and a frequency response of 30-100Hz should be able to do a minimum of 131dB at 30Hz. The fact is that most would not because they are built to achieve that high peak number, not solid, deep bass, so they won't get close to reaching peak performance at their low frequency corner. Assuming the 137 dB was scored at a peak and the box is +-3 dB. If the box in question achieved the flat response to 30Hz through an EQ boost of 3 dB then it will only reach 127dB at 30Hz. This is a 10dB difference between the claimed output and what you get at the low end of the spectrum. That's not just misleading, it's downright fake. BASSBOSS subwoofers are designed to deliver peak performance where you want peak performance of a subwoofer to be: in the low end!

      "content": "Q: Is there a way to tell when my pre MK3 BASSBOSS subwoofer is being pushed too hard or peaking? There are multiple, redundant stages of limiting in the processing and the amplifier. The amp won't clip. This means you don't have to worry about keeping an eye on the back of the subwoofer. There is no clip light because the amp won't clip. It will compress, but there is no light to indicate when the limiter is active. When the volume stops getting louder, then you've reached maximum output. Follow proper gain-structure procedures and you won't overdrive your subs. If you don't put clipped signal into the subwoofer, the driver will survive. Here are some dos and don'ts that will help your subwoofers have a long and happy life: Don't use high-pass or low-pass filters on the signal to the subs because the filters are already built-in. Don't add gain to the point of clipped signals through secondary mixers or processors. Do use high-pass filters on inputs for vocal microphones. Don't use turntables unless they are used to control digital files. Turntable technology was developed before high-output, low-frequency subs and they tend to cause feedback and over-excursion because they are never adequately isolated. The protect light will flash a coded sequence if the amplifier detects a problem. The one you're most likely to see that indicates some kind of limit is the 6-6, which indicates that the amplifier isn't getting enough power to run at maximum capacity. Usually the remedy is to eliminate power strips, light gauge and/or long extension cords or eliminate other power drains from your subwoofers' circuit. Here are some of the codes, all of which can be found in the owner's manual... Long flashes followed by short flashes: 1-0 GROUND NOT CONNECTED: Amp still runs. Blinks 10 times on power-up then stops. Check power cord and outlet wiring. 1-1 LINE HOT AND NEUTRAL REVERSED: Amp still runs. Blinks 10 times on power-up then stops.

      "content": "In comparison to other speakers with very high input sensitivity, the BASSBOSS subs can seem to play at a lower level. This is because when a high sensitivity input and a low sensitivity input are sent the same signal, the high-sensitivity input will add more gain. The appropriate course of action is to establish the maximum output capability of the low-sensitivity unit first, to establish whether the source device can drive enough signal into that unit for it to reach maximum output. Once that's established, the high-sensitivity unit can be added but its input should be attenuated so that it doesn't reach its maximum output capacity before the low-sensitivity unit reaches its maximum output capacity. All that said, subwoofers are inevitably less efficient than tops. It takes more power to reach a given SPL from a sub than from a top. The maximum output SPL of a top can be (usually is) greater than that of a sub of a similar scale. In other words, it's necessary to drive subs harder than tops, or to provide more subs than tops, in order to achieve the desired balance of low frequencies to high frequencies. That desired balance usually involves a minimum of 6dB more SPL from the subs than the tops. Building that disparity into the inputs of the cabinets would tend to put the subwoofer into compression/limiting way before the same would happen on the tops, so the appropriate action is to lower the levels of the tops or to add more subs until the levels are as desired when the speaker are driven with the same signal. If the issue is related to a difference in input sensitivity between brands, it's easily addressed with a little knob turning. Here's some simple instructions that may help: When setting up a sound system with both subwoofers and tops, you might notice that the subwoofers seem quieter than expected. This is because different speakers respond differently to the same input signal. To get the best sound: First, set up the subwoofer to play at its maximum safe level. Then, add the tops speakers, but turn them down so they don't overpower the subwoofer. It's important to know that subwoofers generally need more power than regular speakers to produce the same volume level. This means you'll often need to: Drive subwoofers harder than tops speakers Use more subwoofers than tops speakers The goal is usually to have the bass (from subwoofers) about 6 decibels louder than the rest of the sound. To achieve this, you should: Lower the volume of the regular speakers, or Add more subwoofers This approach helps ensure that all parts of your sound system work together smoothly, without any one part being pushed too hard before the others reach their full potential.",

To achieve this, you should: Lower the volume of the regular speakers, or Add more subwoofers This approach helps ensure that all parts of your sound system work together smoothly, without any one part being pushed too hard before the others reach their full potential.</p>"

Poorly made or broken cables: Bad cables have been found to be the cause of issues that were initially blamed on the speakers. Intermittently bad cables can cause popping noises. The making and breaking of signal-level contacts makes a sound like the speaker is popping. Signal level clipping: To evaluate whether this is the case, eliminate all electronics between the controller (or whatever the source of the music is, such as CDJ and DJM setup,) and the speakers. Turn the \"Master\" level all the way down, leave the EQs at flat, and turn the input level on the controller up all the way, both the trim and the channel fader. Connect the speakers directly to the master outputs of the controller and put them in preset 1. Turn the signal input all the way up on the speaker. Barely move the output level above \"off\" and listen to the sound coming out of the speaker. Is it crystal clear and perfect? If it's not perfect, lower the input trim until it sounds perfect. Raise the output higher until the speaker shows the -3dB LED. All good or anything popping? If no popping, raise the level more until the limit LED is coming on. Any popping? If there's any popping under these circumstances, there may be issues with an internal contact, the woofer or the DSP. Submit a ticket here. When going into any mixer from a controller, a line-input must be used. Running a controller into a mic input can cause that input to clip, causing distortion that might cause popping noises. If popping only happens when a secondary device is in use, look for the cause there. Doing any signal processing in any other device could cause internal clipping or could cause the signal reaching the speakers to be so bass-boosted that it's unrealistic to expect the speaker to reproduce it. Test with all the filters in the mixer bypassed. If the popping doesn't happen when the source is connected directly to the speakers but does happen when other equipment is connected, then the other equipment is likely causing the issue. For MK2 and previous subwoofers: The issue may be in the lamp-based protection system in your cabinet. MK2 subs used lamps to buffer the current going through the coils. If one of the lamps' filaments breaks intermittently, the result is a popping noise that sounds like the driver is popping. The good news is that fixing this issue is very inexpensive! In series with each woofer is a set of 500W Halogen bulbs. These bulbs are readily available through hardware stores and online, usually for less than $2.00 each. It's recommended that you replace them all while you have the cabinet open. They are 120V, 500W R7S 118mm heavy-duty lamps. Here is an article with instructions and links to the parts required. Notes on Performance from David Lee on the DV12 and SV9 There are always what one might call \"practical limitations\" to speakers. The DV12 and the SV9 are not subwoofers. They can produce a fair amount of bass, but the woofers also plays midrange, which all woofers do more easily and efficiently than they make bass. To put that another way, for the same amount of power input, any woofer will make much more midrange than bass. Most people listening to dance music want more bass than midrange, which is what necessitates subwoofers. To give an idea of how much the demand for bass is above midrange, and the relative ease with which midrange can be made, the ratio can be as high as 4:1 of subwoofers to tops. Trying to get a level of bass that's close to what's desired in modern music from a single 12\" or single 9\" top cabinet is going to push that top's driver past its limits. Two high-powered 12\" tops could be used with 6 or 8 single 18\" subwoofers and the tops would easily keep up. They will definitely \"outrun\" a single 15\" sub. If the DV12 or SV9 cabinet is being run in full-range mode with heavy bass music, it may be that it's giving all it can and that's the limit. In this case, the speaker will make a popping sound, indicating that it has exceeded its performance abilities and should be turned down, and ideally paired with a subwoofer (or two). This issue is only present in the absence of sufficient bass output, so providing the system with sufficient low-frequency output for your genres and output needs will fix this problem.",

What would you recommend to decrease that “boomy” sound? The short answer: Avoid using overlapping presets; use lower numbers on the subs, higher on the tops for a less boomy sound. The rabbit hole A- In the case of a hollow stage, the boomy sound is most likely related to the resonance of the stage deck itself, in combination with the resonance of the cavity beneath it. The best way to avoid that resonance is to minimize the energy being fed into the structure, and the best way to do that is to not make any physical contact with that structure. The trouble is... gravity. That said, there will be supports running under the decking, and placing subs on those supports rather than between them is a good place to start. Since the decking moves vertically to re-radiate the energy, in this case gravity can help. More weight on the stage can help shift the resonance lower, potentially below audibility. If the sound is escaping through openings in the stage, block the openings. That’s if you can’t fill the cavity with sand or insulation, etc. Probably not, but it had to be said… Back to the panels. They move vertically because they are lying horizontally but their acoustical center isn’t necessarily the same as the subwoofers’, and vibrations move faster through wood than air, meaning you can mis-align the waves in time, causing cancellations instead of reinforcement. Try moving the subs around until you get the least bad effect. For instance, you might get less \"boomyness\" if both subs are on one side rather than one on each side or both in the middle. Stack the subs vertically instead of side-by-side… Face the subs towards each other, (leaving a gap at least a woofer wide) or back-to-back, rather than forwards so that the energy transferred into the stage floor of one is cancelled by the other. As a cone moves forward, the cabinet mass and the friction between the feet and the ground mostly prevents the cabinet from moving backward. The friction between the feet and the floor is where more of the energy is transferred. Putting the subwoofer on a foam pad will allow the cabinet to rock back and forward a bit, allowing the foam to absorb some of that energy. The foam pad needs to be soft to absorb the energy and big in order to distribute the mass of the cabinet over enough area that it won’t compress until it’s ineffective. A thick couch cushion is a good visual. A yoga mat won’t help. A concrete floor isn’t going to resonate or cause boomyness. Odds are that the boomyness in that environment is related to parallel wall reflections and floor-ceiling reflections. Decoupling won’t help. There’s not a cure but the remedy is to try different subwoofer placement to minimize the worst effects. Think in 3D, in other words, in rooms with hard ceilings and floors, elevate the subs to halfway between them if you can. Try locations for each sub that cause peaks and valleys in different areas. In a symmetrical room, place the subs asymmetrically. The bad areas caused by one location can be filled in from another location. Figuring this stuff out is easier if you can have a sub playing while it’s on a cart and someone can roll it around while someone else is in the listening location.

      "title": "Sound level issues for an overnight, outdoor festival.",
      "content": "Outdoor festival production faces many challenges but one of the most difficult to manage is noise pollution. Bass, aka low-frequency noise propagation, generates the most complaints from local residents. Festivals don't tend to invest in the management of these issues due to the temporary nature of their sound output. It often falls to the individual sound companies to address these issues to the best of their abilities. Long-distance low-frequency sound propagation is a also significant concern for industrial and transportation sectors. Thanks to their extensive resources, software is available to analyze and predict the acoustical paths and potential remedies. An excellent environmental acoustic assessment program that can assist in noise control design and strategy during planning and construction can be found at olivetreelab.com/Terrain Other software specific to the concert production industry can assist in predicting and illustrating steps that can be taken to minimize a festival's impact on the surrounding residents. These programs can be used to predict propagation over shorter distances but also offer valuable information related to how to orient the noise sources in order to dramatically reduce the noise propagation that tends to disturb local residents. Two softwares that are free to the end user are Meyer MAPP XT and AFMG Ease. MAPP predicts the performance of Meyer loudspeaker systems but the laws of acoustics apply to all systems equally. MAPP predicts planar response, which is to say 2-dimensional propagation. You can, however, create a vertical and horizontal prediction of each simulation. Ease allows you to create a single 3D simulation but gives you 2 dimensional views of the propagation. All these programs deal with propagation in air. Propagation of sound system energy through the ground is not considered. The speed of sound in solids is significantly faster than in air but the energy required to move the mass of the ground over large distances is generally greater than can be generated by common loudspeakers. Trucks and trains weighing many tons rolling over bumps generate far more energy into the ground, which is why the transportation industry is a great resource for noise mitigation information. With regard to primary isolation, in a multi-family residence or shared commercial space where people share walls, floors and ceilings, isolation is critical. Preventing the direct transmission of energy from solid to solid, such as from a wooden speaker box to a concrete floor, makes a huge difference in how much energy reaches the neighbors' spaces. For instance, placing a speaker on a sponge rubber mat allows the mat to absorb the vibrations rather than transmit them directly into the concrete. On the other hand, over greater distances where structures aren't physically coupled to each other, separating speakers from the earth isn't of significant benefit. It is known that sand and soils dissipate energy when subjected to cyclic loading, so sand has long been used as an excellent low-frequency absorption medium. Putting speakers on sand is an effective de-coupling mechanism on its own. As far as propagation to distant neighbors are concerned, pallets and blankets appear to have no beneficial effect at the offending frequencies. There are much more effective and relevant options to consider. To illustrate what can be of benefit, I ran simulations in Meyer's MAPP XT of a speaker on the ground and of a speaker elevated 5 feet above the ground. (See below.) The simulation indicates that the elevated speaker (upper simulation) actually propagates more energy over greater distance than does one directly on the ground. (Bottom simulation.) With the speaker elevated, the sound reflected from the ground acts as a second source. These simulations cover a an overall length of 1500 feet with the stage facing from left to right and the propagation distance of 1125 feet from the speakers to the farthest (right) edge of the simulation. The patterns will hold true over greater distances but wind and the terrain do have an increasing effect as distance increases. In looking for ways to provide a more comprehensive and scientific approach to solutions, it's useful to note some additional factors that aren't often considered or understood about sound propagation. Many people have heard that low end is not directional, which is true when a single radiating source is involved, however when there is more than one source of low end, the interactions produce very significant directional effects. Image 2 (above) shows the propagation pattern of a stereo pair of subwoofers placed 20' apart. This pattern is viewed from above. It's clearly evident that the interaction between the two sources creates areas of reduced sound propagation, specifically 45 degrees off axis from the direction of orientation. It's evident that orienting the system(s) has a greater influence over how much energy reaches a particular area than elevating a speaker or any de-coupling concept. A simple plan of orienting systems 45-degrees away from the nearest residences or potential complaint sources would allow the event organizers to minimize the noise levels at the nearest potential complaint points as well as minimize the interference between adjacent systems. Simply drawing a line on the ground or tying a ribbon between two stakes to show which way a system needs to be oriented allows the participants a guide for system placement without restricting their creativity and all that's required to create sufficient directivity is a simple left-right speaker system. If a participant wishes to use a large line of speakers, not in a left-right configuration, (shown in image 3, below) it's still practical to orient such a system so that neighbors both near and far are minimally effected. The area of least radiation for a line of speakers is 90 degrees to their axis but they radiate nearly as much energy backwards as forwards. Pointing a big line of speakers \"away from\" the neighbors isn't nearly as effective as pointing the speakers crosswise relative to the neighbors. If the organizers know where the neighbors are and what the system configuration is, they can provide the information to the participants about which direction to aim their system, again by providing nothing more complicated than a line on the ground. Even greater control can be achieved using cardioid programming, (as shown in image 4, below, also viewed from above) but it is expected that the majority of the systems in use will not have the capabilities or expertise to benefit from this technology. For events that provide the sound systems, and for the audio production companies that serve them, it's worth considering deploying cardioid system configurations to minimize the spill of noise to the surrounding area. Most cardioid configurations are deployed for the benefit of keeping bass levels lower on stage. Even when festival producers specify the need for the control of sound bleeding off site, very few companies are able to utilize these technologies effectively for that purpose. I recommend that anyone interested in growing their production business invest time in learning how to deploy these principles because, as you can see from the information provided in this brief article, even without the application of complex cardioid system setups, it's possible to realize benefits from the naturally occurring interactions between ordinary speakers.",

      "content": "Q: Can you explain program wattage vs. RMS vs. Peak What does it mean if a company claims their box has 6000 program watts and 12000peak watts? A: Peak watts could possibly be defined as theoretical fantasy watts. Essentially calculated momentary/instantaneous output with no load on the amp. Or they might be referring to the maximum instantaneous/momentary power the drivers can stand, but for less time than needed to produce a single cycle of a bass frequency wave. In either case, it's power you can't use. Program watts are very non-specific. They are defined differently by so many different companies that it's hard to know unless they explain in the fine print. (Look for the asterisk and follow the trail... *) RMS watts are also somewhat ambiguous. There are different standards for calculating RMS watts for amplifiers. The question to ask is, how long can the RMS power be sustained? There's always a limiting factor. Heat is one. Power supply capacitance is another. There are more, and they all create limits at different levels with different loads and at different frequencies. Power (Watts) is a specification that's not without context. Power needs to be considered in context with efficiency and purpose. Power, in Watts, is a number derived from current flow and it indicates the consumption of energy. Current flow is promoted by higher voltage and restrained by higher impedance. Those factors can vary wildly, but the consumption of power is NOT the goal of a loudspeaker or amplifier.

      "htmlContent": "<p class=\"font-semibold text-white mt-4\">Q: Can you explain program wattage vs. RMS vs. Peak What does it mean if a company claims their box has 6000 program watts and 12000peak watts? A: Peak watts could possibly be defined as theoretical fantasy watts. Essentially calculated momentary/instantaneous output with no load on the amp. Or they might be referring to the maximum instantaneous/momentary power the drivers can stand, but for less time than needed to produce a single cycle of a bass frequency wave. In either case, it's power you can't use. Program watts are very non-specific. They are defined differently by so many different companies that it's hard to know unless they explain in the fine print. (Look for the asterisk and follow the trail... *) RMS watts are also somewhat ambiguous. There are different standards for calculating RMS watts for amplifiers. The question to ask is, how long can the RMS power be sustained? There's always a limiting factor. Heat is one. Power supply capacitance is another. There are more, and they all create limits at different levels with different loads and at different frequencies. Power (Watts) is a specification that's not without context. Power needs to be considered in context with efficiency and purpose. Power, in Watts, is a number derived from current flow and it indicates the consumption of energy. Current flow is promoted by higher voltage and restrained by higher impedance. Those factors can vary wildly, but the consumption of power is NOT the goal of a loudspeaker or amplifier. The OBJECTIVE is to generate sound pressure. More specifically, the goal is to produce EQUAL sound pressure over a range of frequencies.

      "content": "Embark on a journey to demystify the crucial realm of audio delay in this insightful discussion. Delve into the science behind delay calculations and discover practical tips for optimizing live audio experiences. David Lee discusses revealing how our brains perceive sound and the importance of prioritizing the first arrival. Uncover challenges in delaying subs versus tops and learn to navigate compromises for optimal auditory immersion. Hi, I'm David Lee from BASSBOSS and often delayed. But delay can be a useful thing. To start off with when we've got BASSBOSS systems set up, kind of like they are behind me here where the cabinets are effectively aligned with each other physically, there's no need to use delay. All the cabinets have all the necessary processing to operate coherently. When you start physically separating the boxes by distances of more than three feet is when delay starts to become necessary. When you think about delay, it's always going to give you a single point at which you have ideal summation of two speakers that are not co-located. In other words, and you can delay to a certain spot, but not everywhere. So the best thing you can do is to co-locate speakers as much as possible so that you don't have to delay due delays on them. You may have a speaker on the outside of a 100-foot room that needs to cover a patio and the sounds coming out the door. And if you didn't delay it, it would be a train wreck. So you need delay. You may have a situation where your subs are center stage and your tops are way off in the left and right, and they really aren't working well at all. For whatever reason, you may need to delay the sounds. There's other things. You have an array of subwoofers that you're trying to expand the coverage of, so you have to do progressive delay. There's other ways to do that, actually, other than just delay. But that's a one that's more readily accessible and fairly easy to implement. When you have a distance that's greater than one quarter wavelength at that transition frequency between, you know, how close one element is from the other, depending on which one, it doesn't really matter. You have to always delay the one that's closer because unfortunately, we can't go backwards in time. So you're moving the closer one further away. So when you have something like a speaker on a patio that's 30, 40, 50 feet away, you will run that signal through a delay and delay it. How? Okay, if you don't have measurement gear, then you can do relatively simple math. You want to button clearly. I mean, when I say measurement gear, I mean microphones and computers and stuff like that. Other measurement gear would be a tape measure or a laser measure, but you can do it with your feet and pace it out. Whatever kit, close the normal sort of ballpark range of what you want to do for delay is speed of sound is roughly 1,125 feet per second varies with temperature, altitude, such like. But if you do the math on 1,125, you're going to be close enough and you can do a little bit more. So you figure out how far you've got in feet for this calculation. In meters, it's 343 meters per second. So if you do it in feet, it's 1125. So 1.1125 feet per millisecond. So 0.8889 milliseconds per foot. I think I got that right. So if you figure out how far you can multiply by 0.8889 and get how many milliseconds you need to delay, and then for an effect, it's called the Precedence Effect, you can put an extra 10 milliseconds on there. If you look at it really long distances, it doesn't really work. But, you know, if you've got 1.1125 every eight feet, you're getting another millisecond. So you could be close by just doing it in feet per millisecond because you do want a little bit more delay, because what happens if you do have a little bit more delay is that when somebody is near to that second speaker, the one that they are closer to, that the system is far away from. You don't want them to hear that speaker first and then the main system, you want them to hear the arrival of the main system first and then have it reinforced by the closer speaker. Our brains locate sound based on the first arrival so that the first arrival is coming from the main system. Even if the fill speaker is above their head to the right, they will still recognize this source as being whatever that is. The stage, the boost, whatever. As an example of this, I've had several occasions where somebody, you know, got my attention, said that speaker's not working and I like that speaker, that speaker's working. In occasions when I can actually do this, I'll go hang on and I'll turn off the main speakers and I'll be like, Whoa, okay. That's working. How come I couldn't hear it? You could. It's just that your brain was telling you the sound was coming from the main source over there by the podium, by the stage, whatever, because that's what we wanted it to do. So that's why you want to add just a little bit more than the distance. Now, I will say that we are going to assume that the latency, the throughput latency to the main system and the delayed system are the same so that you can just do the math from one speaker of the main array to the delayed speaker. Whether it's ten feet, there are 100 feet. The math is effectively the same. It gets a little complicated when you're mixing subs and tops because when you're delaying subs versus tops, you've got them operating in different frequencies. And it's critical that they sum coherently at the frequencies at which they're both producing energy. If one's early and the other one's late, they'll cancel at that transition frequency. So you have to watch out for that. And it's again, it's a problem because your listening point, your measuring point is a single point. But anywhere else further away, closer into the left, to the right, higher up, that lower down is going to have a different relative distance between the two sources. So, you got to be careful about where you center, where you measure, where you reference to. You want that to be a relevant place. That's not too close because then it'll be all further away where there's a greater number of audience members and you don't need it to be too far either because so you've got to judge where the most practical place to have best impact is and align to that point. There will be compromises closer, there will be compromises further away. So, life is full of compromises and oftentimes we're too late. Enjoy.",

Dive deep into the realm of acoustics as we explore the complex interplay between listener proximity, the reflective properties of floor boundaries, and their impact on the subwoofer's low-frequency response. Okay. Is there an appreciable difference between standing up a subwoofer the tall way or laying it down horizontally? Yes, there is. What are the advantages and disadvantages? Well, some of them are dumb and obvious. Standing a subwoofer up vertically gives you a higher stack platform to put something else on it. Okay. How much are you going to pay in terms of sound pressure level performance with that speaker standing up versus if it were lying down and you had something else to bring that top box higher up? This is down to boundaries. The floor is your consistent boundary. Generally speaking, if you've got your subs on the floor, the more floor you have reflecting the sound from the subwoofer, the better. Relative to the lower frequency. So you will get slightly better low frequency response on axis with a horizontally deployed subwoofer versus a vertically deployed subwoofer. But that's on axis, particularly on the floor. As you come up from the floor that shifts. So sometimes people will notice that a standing subwoofer will have a little bit more impact than a subwoofer on the floor. And that's partly due to the fact that you're getting that energy from both those drivers on axis. It’s also due to the fact that when you have that boundary load of the floor on both woofers equally, they load against a pressure boundary. That's the same on both woofers. And when you stand a box up, you have one driver closer to the floor. So it's actually pressure boundary is less than the pressure boundary on the upper woofer, so they actually react slightly differently. So they react very slightly differently in terms of frequency response and in terms of time, it's very slightly. But you know, it's one of those things where we can perceive it to an extent. So when we're standing in front of a standing double 18, we will probably get a slightly more impact from it in terms of what we perceive rather than when that's lying down. The low frequency advantage that them being horizontal or it being horizontal is providing. We're more sensitive to the upper bass gain than we are to the lower bass gain. And again, with the proximity and the fact that that upper woofer is actually now closer to us than the two woofers on the floor would be, these things factor in to how we perceive that energy. Yes, you can do it either way. You will be able to, if you go to the trouble measure, slightly more deeper bass response on the floor with a horizontal subwoofer if it’s a double 18 or ZV28 and standing up it will measure slightly less low frequency on the floor in front of that box. All of these different factors that one woofer’s further away, the acoustical center’s now further away, you've got less boundary load, you've got less pressure boundary for the woofer to act against. So, but perceptually, it's not going to have an improvement when it's on the floor horizontally versus vertically. It will have a measurable benefit at those low frequencies and how they propagate it and how far they go in terms of, you know, the back of the venue further away from the speakers, it might become a little bit more noticeable that that horizontal deployment is better for those very, very low frequencies. We humans are not that sensitive to those low frequencies. So we don't notice the changes in those low frequencies as readily as we notice the changes in the higher frequencies in the regions that vertical subwoofer tends to advantage. There you go.

      "title": "Watts Going on Here? Transition from MK2 to MK3 amp ratings",
      "content": "BASSBOSS Mk2 subs only listed the RMS power. BASSBOSS Mk2 tops listed the RMS EIAJ power. The MK3 line does not list RMS or peak power. Why? The reason we changed the listings to not include the RMS designation in the MK3 line was due to the change in amplifiers and amplifier technologies. Those new amps and technologies provided reasons why I felt it wasn’t necessary to reduce the listed power rating. Specifically, the new amplifiers could deliver higher SPL than the previous amplifiers. Unfortunately, very unfortunately, many people have been conditioned to believe that Watts are the most important number to check on a spec sheet, so changing the number of Watts to a lower number of RMS Watts would have caused more confusion and generated more questions than leaving the numbers essentially where they were and removing the RMS notation. The questions would have been something like, “How can you make more SPL with less power?” and the answer would be, “You can’t.” So Watt’s wrong with that situation? Well, what’s wrong is the focus on test-bench, amplifier-maker, marketing Watts instead of how the amplifier design delivers useful power to a dynamic load to produce SPL, not to mention how the loudspeaker itself converts those (absolutely silent) Watts into pressure waves you can hear and feel. The obvious conclusion I came to is that the numbers provided under the Power specifications are comparable because they produce essentially comparable sound pressure levels regardless of how many Watts were measured putting power into a resistor on a test-bench. In other words, the power produced by the new amplifiers is better suited to producing SPL from dynamic transducers (aka woofers) than the previous amplifiers, regardless of how that power is/was specified. BASSBOSS Mk2 subwoofer amps, the Watt, the why and the how many. Back in the early days of SMPS amplifiers, they were amazingly loud and clear but they had no ass. They sucked on subs. It was a fact. Everybody knew, if you want fat low end, you need a heavy amp with a big power supply. You needed those old-fashioned RMS Watts and not those new-fangled Peak watts those SMPS amps were shouting about. And for what seemed like a very long time, that was true. But things change. A few people designing SMPS amplifiers were figuring out how to make them deliver bass. It turned out that SMPS actually had some advantages when it came to controlling big woofers and delivering big bass, but it took a few generations of designs to discover and realize that potential. SMPS amps still had a reputation for not being good on subs when I was involved in some interesting events. As I recall there were two in Oklahoma, two in Texas, one in Florida, one in Washington and at least two in New York in which I participated. At each event, several of the biggest, baddest bass amps on the market were brought together with several of the biggest, baddest subwoofers on the market and a variety of tests were done. Without getting too deep into the specifics, we (the subwoofer-obsessed community) were trying to figure out the best way to make the best possible bottom end. The biggest class A/B amps from Crest, Crown, QSC and the like were tested and compared to SMPS amps from Powersoft, Full Fat, MC2, SpeakerPower and others. On various occasions, all amps were tested on a variety of subwoofer cabinet designs from an assortment of manufacturers including Danley, McCauley, EAW, EM, JTR and BASSBOSS. It was great experience and I learned a lot from these tests. For example, I learned that certain types of amps make certain types of speakers sound decidedly different and that their power rating wasn’t the determining factor. In other words, it was possible to pick a favorite amp for each subwoofer type, but it wasn’t possible to pick one best amp for all of the different types of subwoofers. For example, an amp that sounded best on horn loaded subs didn’t necessarily work as well on a vented sub, and vise-versa. There were tests of a variety of subs on the same amp. There were tests of a variety of subs on a variety of amps. At one big event, the group voted for a single subwoofer set with which to do a blind test of the available amplifiers. During the listening tests, the listeners made notes about what they liked or didn’t like about each amplifier without knowing which amplifier was connected to the subs. The amps were hooked up in random order, out of sight of the listeners, and they made notes on the amps from 1-7. The tests were done in this way to weed out bias and to separate the specs from the listening/feeling experience. Discussion ensued. There was no consensus on the winner but there was on the loser. Nevertheless, there were 3 top contenders in the amp tests, and for different reasons based on the taste preference of the “judges”. The SMPS amps did extremely well. Better than most had expected. The top 4 were all SMPS amps. As I recall, the three top amps were MC2, SpeakerPower and Powersoft. MC2 was judged to be the smoothest and was given the most points for “sound quality”. (I believe that’s partly due to their excellent, super-smooth limiter configurations.) Powersoft was the loudest, hardest hitting and was preferred by those who love big impact. (This was likely due to the extremely high voltage-swings that they are capable of.) SpeakerPower got the nod for “deepest”. (Words like “warmer” or “thicker” were used. An interesting difference between it and the Powersoft.) These were SUBJECTIVE tests, the conclusions were based on opinions. Most people there were surprised by which amps they ended up preferring. In other words, once they heard the amps without knowing what they were listening to, and they committed their experience to writing, when they learned which amp they preferred, it was very often not the one they had thought they preferred before the test. Another thing they learned was that neither the weight nor the Watt ratings could predict the winners. What would you do with the information learned from tests like these? Well, MC2 didn’t make power modules for self-powered speakers. The other two winners did make modules, but they were good at different things. Impact, which is produced with high-voltage swings over short duration, is desirable for mid-bass, midrange and HF frequencies. Subwoofers, in my opinion, are not the tools with which to produce impact, which requires rapid acceleration of transducers to create rapid rises in pressure. Subwoofer cones are too heavy for that, at least if they are actually subwoofers and not just extra woofers, so the best amp for a subwoofer would seem to be one that doesn’t necessarily deliver a lot of output very quickly, but rather one that can sustain its output for a longer duration, or so it seemed from the comparisons at the time. Now you’d expect amplifier manufacturers know their products’ strengths pretty well, and they would also tend to know, but not disclose, their weaknesses. But I chose different amp manufacturers for different applications based on their specific strengths. SpeakerPower made amplifiers that could deliver current like no other amplifier I have ever tested. If you hooked up enough fans to one of the biggest ones, you might be able to tig-weld with it. There was no subwoofer load it couldn’t drive. A proper diesel of an amp. They had no trouble putting out their 2400/4000 Watts into 4/2 ohms respectively. SpeakerPower promoted the amps based on those specifications and we put them to good use to do what they did. That’s the good news. Big Watts was, and is, Powersoft’s claim to fame. Powersoft could deliver massive voltage swings for huge dynamic impact. The Powersoft amps did what they do best, which made the mid-high cabinets sound loud and powerful. More good news! So what’s the bad news? The bad news is that although the SpeakerPower can deliver massive amounts of current, and can drive large numbers of woofers on a channel, they can’t deliver the higher voltages that are needed to deliver increased SPL from just 1 or 2 woofers to make them competitive with more recently developed technologies/topologies. The bad news is the Powersoft’s voltage swings were impressive but brief, which is why they specify using EIAJ, and while they were the high-voltage leaders when we first started using them, competitors are now offering even higher voltage swings in more practical configurations that deliver superior performance. Is there more bad news? Each company’s specifications were based on a different set of tests, a different standard for achieving the stated power and a different USP/secret sauce. The SpeakerPower amp will deliver 2400W by using 98 Volts to push 24.5 Amps through 4 Ohms and it will do that for 10 seconds before the output devices start even thinking about waving flags and declaring a heatwave. Impressive! But a 4-ohm coil can’t often take 24A for 10 seconds without suffering heatstroke. And, importantly, very importantly, most of the impedance curve of a loudspeaker is above the driver’s nominal impedance. So even if you can deliver enough current to melt any reasonably efficient voice coil at 4 Ohms, what happens when the impedance rises? How much power do you get to use at 20 Ohms? Only 480 Watts. How do you add 3dB to the output of a loudspeaker? Double the power. OK, only 960Watts. Well below the amp’s stated capabilities, but no way to get there because the only way to raise the power is to raise the voltage. To get 960 Watts through 20 Ohms you need 138 Volts. If you can’t deliver those 138Volts, you won’t get those 3dB. What should you do? Stick with the amp that can deliver what it says, a full 2400Watts through 4 ohms from 98 Volts, or would it be worth looking for an amp that could deliver more voltage because you can actually use that higher voltage to generate higher SPL? And what about on the other side? The much touted 3000 Watts of Powersoft Power? How does Powersoft achieve this remarkable amount of power? They test differently. They called their power Watts RMS EIAJ. That reference is hard to find now because they caught a fair bit of flak for it, so it’s disappeared from most of their specs, but here’s how it works. Meeting the EIAJ standard requires the stated power to be delivered in a repeating cycle for 8ms out of every 32ms. This represents a fairly dense 25% duty cycle compared to the average duty cycle of full-range music at 12.5%, but critically it allows time for the power supply to re-charge between bursts. In other words, the bridged amp is supposed to deliver 3000 Watts RMS for 8ms. The test signal is 1kHz sine wave. 8ms allows 8 diaphragm cycles at 1kHz. It would be loud, for sure. But not deep. Where does that leave the power for bass? 8ms would allow for one diaphragm cycle at 125Hz. What if you don’t allow the recovery time? To put that another way, what happens to the power output when the demand is sustained for longer periods? Like actual bass notes? It drops. A lot. As I recall, and I’ll have to re-verify to be sure, if you run a continuous bass sine wave into a Powersoft 3000W amp, sustained output drops to about 42V into 4 ohms, or about 440W. Not the ideal result in a subwoofer. So let’s compare. Worst-case scenario: Powersoft’s 440 Watts into 4 ohms, not great. SpeakerPower’s 480 Watts into 20 Ohms, also not great. Best-case scenario: Powersoft’s 1200 Watts into 20 Ohms, which should be pretty loud, but it will be brief. SpeakerPower’s 2400 Watts into 4 Ohms, in which case the amp will survive but the speaker will need protection. Protection? What does that mean? It means limiting. Limiters have to be in place to protect the voice coils from overheating due to passing too much current, and to protect the driver suspension from excessive excursion. Interesting? Yup, you can’t actually use all the power that either of these two amps provide. One of them will melt the coil into a puddle and the other will smash it into a pole. Unless they are limited. But it’s never that simple because either one could smash the coil or melt the coil, so they both have to be limited in both aspects. And if they’re limited, how many Watts are you getting from your 2400 or 3000 Watt amplifier after all? Well, this is getting closer to the point. How many Watts are you buying? All of them? Without the limiters in place, there’s no warranty on the drivers… Are you buying Watts when you buy a speaker? Technically you’re only buying Watts when you pay your electric bill. In the big picture, when you buy speakers, what you’re probably after is happy customers, and a happy you, because you made them happy and maybe because it was easy and trouble-free to make them happy using the speakers you bought. Maybe a happy you because you got to play music and it sounded great! If you checked the electric meter and it turned out you used less watts than you expected, would that make you less happy? But seriously, did I say not all the Watts? Here are some thoughts: If there are limiters that restrict the output power of the amplifier to protect the woofer or tweeter, should the published power rating of the amplifier be reduced? And should price of the cabinet be lower because less than the absolute maximum number of Watts of which the amplifier is capable can be accessed at any given time and at any given frequency? Or for a shorter duration of time than forever? If you bought a 3000 Watt speaker and a year later you learned that it turns out you haven’t been using all 3000 Watts, should you get a refund for the Watts you haven’t needed? If the speaker can do the same jobs and play at the same sound level and make the same money while being more efficient, using less power, wasting less Watts as heat, is the speaker less valuable? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Side note: Did you know that horsepower can be converted into Watts? Mathematically, that is. I bought a motorcycle that can deliver 160 horsepower. That’s 117,679 Watts! Damn! If only it was an amplifier! Nobody usually bothers to clarify but yes, that’s peak horsepower, with the peak output only available at 9200RPM. It turns out I can’t use all 160 horsepower for a lot of reasons… Firstly because that 160 horsepower is measured at the crankshaft output. It turns out that at the rear wheel there’s only about 135 horsepower available. And it’s only available at 9,200RPM! What a rip-off! Of course the thing is a beast if you wind it up to 9200RPM. Proper! But I don’t need to, meaning I don’t use all 135 horsepower, never mind 160 horsepower. But if I did wind it up to peak power RPM and try to use it all, I couldn’t anyway because, well, traction control, and, traffic, and, laws, and, corners, and, tires, and, well, I know better than to expect to use all the horsepower because shit will go sideways, which is another fun topic altogether… Nevertheless, I don’t want a refund because it’s nice to know they put all the parts in there that have the POTENTIAL to deliver that peak horsepower, because it’s effortless for the engine to produce 100 horsepower, and there are occasions when I think I might have used that much… maybe. And there have been occasions when, at nowhere near peak horsepower, I’ve noticed the traction control kicking in, cutting power, and that’s not a bad thing when you’re crossing some gravel in an intersection, keeping things under control… Probably better than the alternative! So there again, I don’t mind not having access to all the peak horsepower because it could very well do a lot more harm than good. I have to admit, the folks who built the motorcycle put too much power in it, so they put limiters on it, because nobody needs motorcycle with 160 peak horsepower, but people like me buy them because they are fun to play with and sometimes fun to brag about. I’ll admit I don’t tell people I have a 135 horsepower motorcycle, I tell them I have a 160 horsepower motorcycle! Of course I won’t have 160 horsepower at the rear wheel, and of course I won’t have 160 horsepower at any other RPM, and I’m not all upset about it. Because I didn’t buy the motorcycle because it had a power rating of 160 horsepower. I bought it to ride. When I ride, I have all the power I need, and I’m also happy that I don’t need to ask it to operate at its limits. I don’t care if I can’t actually use all the horsepower they claim it’s capable of producing. It does what I bought it to do. No complaints.",

      "htmlContent": "<p class=\"text-gray-300\">BASSBOSS <strong class=\"text-white\">Mk2</strong> subs only listed the RMS power. BASSBOSS <strong class=\"text-white\">Mk2</strong> tops listed the RMS EIAJ power. The <strong class=\"text-white\">MK3</strong> line does not list RMS or peak power. Why? The reason we changed the listings to not include the RMS designation in the <strong class=\"text-white\">MK3</strong> line was due to the change in amplifiers and amplifier technologies. Those new amps and technologies provided reasons why I felt it wasn’t necessary to reduce the listed power rating. Specifically, the new amplifiers could deliver higher SPL than the previous amplifiers. Unfortunately, very unfortunately, many people have been conditioned to believe that Watts are the most important number to check on a spec sheet, so changing the number of Watts to a lower number of RMS Watts would have caused more confusion and generated more questions than leaving the numbers essentially where they were and removing the RMS notation. The questions would have been something like, “How can you make more SPL with less power?” and the answer would be, “You can’t.” So Watt’s wrong with that situation? Well, what’s wrong is the focus on test-bench, amplifier-maker, marketing Watts instead of how the amplifier design delivers useful power to a dynamic load to produce SPL, not to mention how the loudspeaker itself converts those (absolutely silent) Watts into pressure waves you can hear and feel. The obvious conclusion I came to is that the numbers provided under the Power specifications are comparable because they produce essentially comparable sound pressure levels regardless of how many Watts were measured putting power into a resistor on a test-bench. In other words, the power produced by the new amplifiers is better suited to producing SPL from dynamic transducers (aka woofers) than the previous amplifiers, regardless of how that power is/was specified. BASSBOSS <strong class=\"text-white\">Mk2</strong> subwoofer amps, the Watt, the why and the how many. Back in the early days of SMPS amplifiers, they were amazingly loud and clear but they had no ass. They sucked on subs. It was a fact. Everybody knew, if you want fat low end, you need a heavy amp with a big power supply. You needed those old-fashioned RMS Watts and not those new-fangled Peak watts those SMPS amps were shouting about. And for what seemed like a very long time, that was true. But things change. A few people designing SMPS amplifiers were figuring out how to make them deliver bass. It turned out that SMPS actually had some advantages when it came to controlling big woofers and delivering big bass, but it took a few generations of designs to discover and realize that potential. SMPS amps still had a reputation for not being good on subs when I was involved in some interesting events. As I recall there were two in Oklahoma, two in Texas, one in Florida, one in Washington and at least two in New York in which I participated. At each event, several of the biggest, baddest bass amps on the market were brought together with several of the biggest, baddest subwoofers on the market and a variety of tests were done. Without getting too deep into the specifics, we (the subwoofer-obsessed community) were trying to figure out the best way to make the best possible bottom end. The biggest class A/B amps from Crest, Crown, QSC and the like were tested and compared to SMPS amps from Powersoft, Full Fat, MC2, SpeakerPower and others. On various occasions, all amps were tested on a variety of subwoofer cabinet designs from an assortment of manufacturers including Danley, McCauley, EAW, EM, JTR and BASSBOSS. It was great experience and I learned a lot from these tests. For example, I learned that certain types of amps make certain types of speakers sound decidedly different and that their power rating wasn’t the determining factor. In other words, it was possible to pick a favorite amp for each subwoofer type, but it wasn’t possible to pick one best amp for all of the different types of subwoofers. For example, an amp that sounded best on horn loaded subs didn’t necessarily work as well on a vented sub, and vise-versa. There were tests of a variety of subs on the same amp. There were tests of a variety of subs on a variety of amps. At one big event, the group voted for a single subwoofer set with which to do a blind test of the available amplifiers. During the listening tests, the listeners made notes about what they liked or didn’t like about each amplifier without knowing which amplifier was connected to the subs. The amps were hooked up in random order, out of sight of the listeners, and they made notes on the amps from 1-7. The tests were done in this way to weed out bias and to separate the specs from the listening/feeling experience. Discussion ensued. There was no consensus on the winner but there was on the loser. Nevertheless, there were 3 top contenders in the amp tests, and for different reasons based on the taste preference of the “judges”. The SMPS amps did extremely well. Better than most had expected. The top 4 were all SMPS amps. As I recall, the three top amps were MC2, SpeakerPower and Powersoft. MC2 was judged to be the smoothest and was given the most points for “sound quality”. (I believe that’s partly due to their excellent, super-smooth limiter configurations.) Powersoft was the loudest, hardest hitting and was preferred by those who love big impact. (This was likely due to the extremely high voltage-swings that they are capable of.) SpeakerPower got the nod for “deepest”. (Words like “warmer” or “thicker” were used. An interesting difference between it and the Powersoft.) These were SUBJECTIVE tests, the conclusions were based on opinions. Most people there were surprised by which amps they ended up preferring. In other words, once they heard the amps without knowing what they were listening to, and they committed their experience to writing, when they learned which amp they preferred, it was very often not the one they had thought they preferred before the test. Another thing they learned was that neither the weight nor the Watt ratings could predict the winners. What would you do with the information learned from tests like these? Well, MC2 didn’t make power modules for self-powered speakers. The other two winners did make modules, but they were good at different things. Impact, which is produced with high-voltage swings over short duration, is desirable for mid-bass, midrange and HF frequencies. Subwoofers, in my opinion, are not the tools with which to produce impact, which requires rapid acceleration of transducers to create rapid rises in pressure. Subwoofer cones are too heavy for that, at least if they are actually subwoofers and not just extra woofers, so the best amp for a subwoofer would seem to be one that doesn’t necessarily deliver a lot of output very quickly, but rather one that can sustain its output for a longer duration, or so it seemed from the comparisons at the time. Now you’d expect amplifier manufacturers know their products’ strengths pretty well, and they would also tend to know, but not disclose, their weaknesses. But I chose different amp manufacturers for different applications based on their specific strengths. SpeakerPower made amplifiers that could deliver current like no other amplifier I have ever tested. If you hooked up enough fans to one of the biggest ones, you might be able to tig-weld with it. There was no subwoofer load it couldn’t drive. A proper diesel of an amp. They had no trouble putting out their 2400/4000 Watts into 4/2 ohms respectively. SpeakerPower promoted the amps based on those specifications and we put them to good use to do what they did. That’s the good news. Big Watts was, and is, Powersoft’s claim to fame. Powersoft could deliver massive voltage swings for huge dynamic impact. The Powersoft amps did what they do best, which made the mid-high cabinets sound loud and powerful. More good news! So what’s the bad news? The bad news is that although the SpeakerPower can deliver massive amounts of current, and can drive large numbers of woofers on a channel, they can’t deliver the higher voltages that are needed to deliver increased SPL from just 1 or 2 woofers to make them competitive with more recently developed technologies/topologies.

      "content": "In technical terms what we're describing with the word \"throw\" usually is a matter of SPL at distance. Barring reflections and interference, sound loses energy at a rate of 6dB per doubling of distance and that affects all subwoofers equally. Individual, portable subwoofers can't be \"long-throw\" by virtue of the fact that they are not large enough to produce meaningful directivity throughout the subwoofer frequency range. Significant directivity is achieved when a dimension of the radiating area is greater than or equal to the wavelength being produced. Therefor it occurs at higher frequencies before lower frequencies, so it's possible for a 36\" wide box to provide reasonable directivity at 187Hz (not subwoofer range) and marginal directivity at 94Hz (not quite subwoofer range) but effectively no directivity as frequencies extend much below that. A subwoofer that operates from 80 Hz down to 25Hz, as most of ours do, are radiating frequencies with wavelengths from 14 feet up to 45 feet. (4.2m to 13.7m) Thus one of our larger cabinets could provide marginal directivity at 80Hz but no appreciable directivity on down from there. Even at 80Hz, there would not be sufficient directivity to be called \"long throw\". And our subwoofers aren't particularly large or small relative to other portable subwoofers, so the same rules would apply to any box of similar dimensions. If a box is designed/tuned to be particularly loud at a particular frequency, it will be perceived to be louder at any distance at that frequency. If that frequency is high enough to be within the range where it can produce limited directivity, it will benefit from an increase in measured/perceived output, on axis, in that range. (Consequently it will be perceived as having less output when off-axis.) Every sub box that I've ever heard to be described as \"long-throw\" was particularly more sensitive at higher frequencies than lower ones. Boxes that are particularly effective at upper-bass frequencies can also benefit from the limited directivity they can provide at those frequencies, making them seem to be very loud and \"long-throw\" but at the price of flat frequency response and low frequency extension. A box that produces a broad range of frequencies at the same level may produce less SPL at a specific frequency (compared to a peaky box as described above) but it will transmit the same range of frequencies at the same level at any distance. Flat frequency response is a design choice that precludes tuning for maximum output at a specific frequency. In the design process, the more you're willing to give up in low-frequency extension, the more output you can achieve further up the spectrum. Also, the narrower the targeted operating bandwidth, the more peak SPL you can achieve. Deeper and smoother are fundamental goals for BASSBOSS subwoofers, so any one-note-wonder has the potential to produce a higher SPL at it's one note forte. The only way to achieve directivity at subwoofer-appropriate frequencies is with an array of boxes. It would be inappropriate to describe the subwoofers in such an array as \"long-throw\". The array may qualify, but the individual parts cannot unless they are impractically large. There are two possible conclusions to be drawn from the physics: 1) Portable/touring products described as long-throw subwoofers are not operating in the subwoofer frequency range, so they are not subwoofers, so they don't exist. 2) Portable/touring products described as long-throw subwoofers that operate in the subwoofer frequency range cannot be long-throw because of the rules of physics, so they don't exist. There’s no such thing as a long-throw subwoofer.",

The array may qualify, but the individual parts cannot unless they are impractically large. There are two possible conclusions to be drawn from the physics: 1) Portable/touring products described as long-throw subwoofers are not operating in the subwoofer frequency range, so they are not subwoofers, so they don't exist. 2) Portable/touring products described as long-throw subwoofers that operate in the subwoofer frequency range cannot be long-throw because of the rules of physics, so they don't exist. There’s no such thing as a long-throw subwoofer.</p>"

      "content": "BASSBOSS creates a variety of different tops that differ in size and application. This article explains the philosophy behind each product to help you narrow down your choices and find a speaker that is right for you. Factors to Consider: Portability (i.e. what size vehicle and team you have) - Larger tops like the Krakatoa and AT312's are big and heavy, making them difficult for single operators working out of a smaller vehicle. However they can also cover a large space relative to the volume you have. Smaller tops like the SV9 are light and easy to move, but they cannot product the SPL as larger tops. Expandability - Tops like the MFLA, DV12, and AT212 can be arrayed in groups to provide additional SPL and coverage when needed. Other tops, like the Krakatoa and AT312, will exhibit comb filtering when attempting to colocate several of them together. What SPL and coverage you need - Tops like the AT212 prioritize SPL (sound pressure level), while the DV12 sacrifices some SPL for deep output What coverage pattern works for you - The DV12 and Sublim8 both feature a 120 degree horn that is perfect for wide rooms. The CCM12 and DiaMon, on the other hand, have a tighter 80 degree conical pattern, which is well suited for monitor duty.

If your priority is SPL and clarity, the AT212 has you covered - it can keep up with many of our double driver subwoofers, achieving incredible volume without sounding harsh or shrill. Equally suited for live or prerecorded music, the AT212 can also array horizontally for even more coverage and SPL. It features 2x 12\" wooers and an incredibly capable 3\" compression driver mounted on a rotatable 60 x 80 degree horn. If you: Are a production company that needs a flexible loudspeaker that provides more clarity and output than several smaller boxes together Typically ground stack your system Need the most output per watt (meaning you may work with generators) Want the expandability the AT212 can provide, with the ability to array and fly both horizontally and vertically Work out of a van or truck The AT212 may be right for you. AT312: The AT312 is also part of our \"Attuned Top\" series, and has been used in large studios, nightclubs, and fixed installations with excellent results. Heavier and slightly larger than the AT212, the coaxial design of the AT312 helps it behave like a studio monitor, providing excellent clarity and accuracy across the spectrum. It was designed to be a low-profile, high-output DJ monitor on top of our SSP218 that provides the SPL needed by headliners without blocking sightlines, but also is at home in fixed installations where it delivers pristine sound. The AT312 features 3x 12\" woofers, the top of which is a coaxial with a 3\" compression driver, delivering incredible consistency and quality across the spectrum. If you: Desire studio-quality sound at high volumes Do not need to array your tops Typically ground stack your system Are installing a system for a studio, nightclub, or house of worship and want to use fewer boxes to get the most coverage and SPL Work out of a van or box truck with at 1-2 helpers The AT312 may be right for you. Krakatoa: Don't let its size fool you, the Krakatoa is basically a massive studio monitor, delivering pristine sound at a massive scale. With that said, the Krakatoa is our largest and heaviest top, meaning it is designed for production teams and fixed installs such as nightclubs and churches that need quality sound over a large area. Entire festivals have been covered with the massive HF output of just two Krakatoas, and even we haven't found out just how loud it gets. The Krakatoa features five 18\" drivers, four around the outside similar to the Kraken, and one in the middle in a triaxial configuration with one of the loudest mid-high drivers ever created. The Krakatoa is incredibly consistent and pristine; if you have the ability to move it and demand uncompromising performance and quality, look no further than the Krakatoa. If you: Regularly put on festivals and large scale events Are doing an install for a large church, theater, or nightclub Need a box that can fly and cover a large area with incredible clarity Want uncompromising quality and excellent stereo imaging Have access to a box truck and a crew to help move it The Krakatoa may be right for you. CCM12 and DiaMon: The CCM12 and DiaMon are both incredibly similar boxes, so they are grouped here as an overview - both boxes share the same driver, amplifier, and acoustic specifications. If you would like more information on the differences between these products, see the article CCM12-MK3 vs DiaMon-MK3. While the CCM12 and DiaMon's small size and coaxial design lends themselves well to monitor duty, don't be fooled - they are also very capable boxes when used as fills, delays, or lightweight mains. The CCM12 and DiaMon both feature a 12\" coaxial woofer with a 3\" compression driver that provides high SPL and quality in a box that only weighs 30lbs, thanks to the shared magnet structure and small size. These boxes thus outperform many 12\" 2-ways that are much larger and heavier. If you: Want a flexible box that can function as a monitor, fill, or light main Do not plan on arraying or expanding your system Desire accurate sound a high gain before feedback Are a production company that wants a flexible floor monitor/wedge (CCM12 only) Work out of a small vehicle or truck and want a 30lb speaker that is easy to mount on a pole by a single person Are constrained by size or weight but need more SPL than the SV9 The CCM12 or DiaMon may be right for you. DV12: The DV12 is part of the DV series, which stands for \"Dual woofer, Vented,\" sharing its name and its heritage with the discontinued DV8 (a 2x8\" cabinet), despite having only one 12\" woofer. The DV12 is our most popular top because it can deliver a large amount of SPL and low frequency without needing subwoofers, thanks to its long-excursion woofer and large 3\" compression driver. If you do pair the DV12 with subwoofers, you can use a higher numbered preset, which allows you to get additional SPL by taking off the low frequency burden. The DV12 can also pair up stack in an inverted array, providing a true +6dB increase in output. The DV12 features a wide 120 degree horizontal coverage, perfect for Wedding DJs, Bands, and production teams that work in wide rooms such as hotel ballrooms. If you: Want a box that can get deep without always needing subwoofers Desire a wide 120 degree coverage pattern that works well in ballrooms and outdoors Want the flexibility of being able to add another pair of boxes when more SPL is needed Are interested in a 2-way cabinet that outperforms most 12\" 2-ways in quality and volume Work out of a sedan or van and want a top that can keep up with many subs The DV12 may be right for you. MFLA: The MFLA stands for \"Medium Format Line Array,\" however the amount of output from the MFLA is anything but \"medium.\" A single MFLA can keep up with several of our largest subwoofers, and a hang of only 7 per side is suitable for some of the largest stages and festivals. The MFLA features 2x 12\" cabinets and 2x 3\" HF drivers in a small package for the sound it produces. With a smart rigging and flying system and multiple deployment options, the MFLA is flexible and expandable. The MFLA is razor flat in its frequency response thanks to its design and provides directivity benefits the more you bring. If you: Need a flexible line-array solution that provides immense SPL with fewer boxes Are a production team or DJ that does large scale events and festivals Are doing an installation for a large nightclub or house of worship Want the ability to mount a box to a VS21 sideways or on top of a Kraken Work out of a box truck with a crew to help set up The MFLA may be right for you Sublim8: Unlike many of the other tops on this list, the Sublim8 is a complete column loudspeaker system that includes a subwoofer. As a top, the Sublim8 features 2x 8\" woofers and a large compression driver with a 3\" voice coil mounted to a line array waveguide. The closest product to the Sublim8's top section is the DV12, as both share the same HF driver and horn, with both providing a wide 120 degree horizontal coverage pattern. See the KnowledgeBASS article The Sublim8 vs Other BASSBOSS Products for more details. If you: Perform at weddings or churches where sightless and aesthetics are important Desire a turnkey solution with maximal output versus footprint Often set up solo Want an option in white Desire wide horizontal coverage over a long distance You want an easy option for mounting a lighting fixture, without needing to bring truss totems The Sublim8 may be the right choice for you! SV9: The SV in the name SV9 refers to the fact that it is a \"Single woofer, Vented cabinet\". The SV9 is our smallest and lightest cabinet, equally at home in a studio and for small events placed under a subwoofer. It was designed for DJs and producers who want a studio monitor they can use at home while also having the ability to go on the road and use it at gigs that don't require a larger system. It features a 9\" woofer and 1.5\" compression driver. If you: Want studio-quality sound in a lightweight package Want a flexible speaker that can work equally well as a studio monitor or gigging speaker Perform at events under 100-150 people Work out of a small vehicle and need a top you can set up by yourself The SV9 may be right for you.

      "content": "Q: Why doesn't BB design more subs like the VS21 hybrid box? For example, having a \"VS18\"? It comes down to a balance of practicalities. The VS21 is bigger than a direct radiator 21\" would be. Any 18\" cabinet with a hybrid horn would be bigger than its direct-radiating counterpart. The larger mass, and therefore greater inertia, of a 21\" cone introduces limitations on the acceleration of that cone. The result is experienced as a lack of \"impact\" or \"punch\". Other descriptions are that 21\" woofers are \"slow \" or \"muddy \" compared to 18\" and, to a larger extent, 15\" cones. The hybrid horn produces higher sensitivity in the upper end of the subwoofer operating range. That higher sensitivity correlates with a reduced demand for excursion in that range. With a reduced demand for excursion comes a reduced demand for acceleration, thus overcoming the generally perceived limitation of the larger 21\" cones being \"slow \". While some heavier, large voice-coil 18\" cones suffer from this limitation, it is to a lesser extent, and most 18\" cones can be accelerated fast enough to not need this secondary advantage. The net takeaway is that building such a cabinet for an 18\" woofer doesn't yield sufficient improvement to warrant the added size, weight, complexity and cost of its construction. People would rather have an 18\" loaded cabinet that is smaller given that the performance of an 18\" woofer in a direct-radiator type construction is not otherwise compromised. We therefore ask ourselves, \"Would a single 18\" cabinet that's significantly larger and more expensive than the SSP118 but not as loud as the VS21 tend to serve anyone better than either the SSP118 or the VS21?\"",

It's a low-quality piece of equipment compared to a high-quality controller and your subwoofer and tops, and compromises your sound quality. In short, it does not help and can often cause problems and even driver failures. Having tested the performance of common small mixers, we can report that they begin to distort below nominal output level and distorts massively when higher output is demanded. Although inputs and outputs may be set to “0”, in tests that mixer couldn’t deliver clean output even well below that level. Using inputs other than 7 and 8 allows separate control of the left and right levels but it also has the potential for delivering an additional 6dB of signal to the mixer outputs due to what’s called “double-bussing”. The combination of double-bussing and running the levels on the mixer at “0” is likely to make the situation even worse. Any speaker connected to one of these mixers will be amplifying its distortion, and we have seen that customers who had failures often have had these mixers in their systems. Removing the mixers has been the solution in several cases. A subwoofer with a powerful amplifier that’s intended to reproduce very low frequencies is more susceptible to damage from this type of signal distortion because it has the power to amplify the distortions and because the frequencies at which the distortions occur are not filtered out.

      "content": "Can I use the Makara on its vertical cart? tl;dr, no, the Makara vertical cart is for transport only, with the grille facing up. Read below to find out why: We offer two wheelcarts for the Makara, one vertical and one horizontal. The Makara isn’t square, and the challenge with using a horizontal cart with the Makara is that it will not fit through many doorways in that orientation, but if it’s desired that the cabinet(s) remain in an operable position on the cart, the horizontal cart is the appropriate cart. For the SSP218 and SSP215, which are also not square, there’s not a vertical cart available. The relevant difference between the SSP218/215 and the Makara is the cabinet depth, which, being 6.5” narrower, allows the cabinets to pass through narrower doorways. In order to allow Makaras to roll through doorways less than 3’ wide, it’s necessary to face the cabinets upwards, like the ZV28, or downwards, which introduces another set of challenges. If horizontal is considered to be with the output facing horizontally, and vertical is with the output facing vertically, what about with the cabinets standing upright with the output facing horizontally? In my view, based on what I’ve seen in how speakers are handled in a production environment, standing it upright on one end would tend to make it too unstable because the wheels can’t be mounted at the extreme corners of the cart. The wheels have to trail behind their vertical central axis, which puts the pivot point at least 6” back from the leading edge of the cart. When a ~300lb, 4’6” tall speaker is being pushed along on a cart with the leading support point 6” behind the leading edge, and it hits a cable, a threshold, a rock, a connector or a pavement transition, it’s entirely too likely that the whole thing will topple over. Someone could get seriously hurt if it was transported in this position. Thus the solution that allows the Makara to be rolled through most doors, and allows it to travel safely on a cart, is to orient the cabinet vertically, face up. Don't the ZV28 and VS21 allow operation on their vertical carts? Technically, the ZV28 cart was designed to allow the cabinet to transport in a vertical orientation, facing upward. The ZV28 does have an additional set of feet which allow the cabinet to be placed on the cart with the drivers facing to the side, but the handles are not accessible in that orientation. The ZV28 is square, and originally didn’t have feet on one side. Since people wanted to use the cabinets standing on one side, feet were added there to protect the cabinet finish, and the addition of the feet on the sides is what makes it possible to use the cart from the side as well. The VS21 is also square, and when horizontal, it is the same width/depth as the Makara. Its vertical cart allows it to be rolled through smaller doorways, but because it’s square, face up or face forward makes no difference to the dimensions of the cart. The VS21 is also asymmetrical, and so had a distinct top and bottom. And since the VS21 already had 12 feet, with 4 on the bottom, adding 4 more to the back of the cabinet didn’t seem practical. Due to the size and weight of the Makara, and where its center of gravity is located, we do not recommend using the Makara vertically while on a wheelcart.",

      "title": "Don't publish Why do you use non-standard sensitivity ratings?",
      "content": "Q: Your specs look a little inflated. Why do you use non-standard sensitivity ratings? Like 1 watt / 1meter in an anechoic chamber? Looks like yours are rated on the floor, with no mention of the input level or amp power for said rating. Please elaborate. David Lee – \"Thanks for your question. I understand and encourage skepticism. I know that in this industry it can be difficult to know who to trust because there are a lot of inflated numbers out there. I'd be happy to clarify anything that appears to be unclear. The practice of using 1 watt at 1 meter is a hold-over from days gone by, when 1 watt was being made by a tube amp and bigger power was difficult to generate. The information it provides is relevant to determining a loudspeaker's sensitivity for comparison to other loudspeakers when each is driven by the same amp. The primary relevance of this is related to comparing passive loudspeakers to see which one would produce more SPL output at 1 watt input. From there one could calculate the theoretical maximum output given the power limit of the amplifier. This doesn't take into account issues like thermal compression, port turbulence, excursion limits or distortion, all of which are extremely low at 1 watt power levels. Because we sell powered loudspeakers, there is no need to reference the sensitivity of the loudspeaker independent of the amplifier, which is why the specific sensitivity at 2.83V into 8 ohms isn't part of the specifications. Our amplifiers, drivers and processing are matched for ultimate performance as a system. I've seen many specifications of sensitivity that, if you investigate them, reference output SPL at frequencies outside their intended operating band. I've often seen sensitivity and peak SPL numbers for subwoofers based on levels at 120, 160 or 200Hz, which is well outside the range I would consider using a \"subwoofer\". It's difficult to have honest numbers be competitive with inflated numbers. Marketing departments and the general public all want to see the biggest numbers possible. Big number for power amps encourage the use of \"peak\" watts specifications. Our subwoofer amps are rated on continuous RMS power. We don't even list peak power. People who know a little more can see the difference but it's still possible for people to be misled. Part of the problem is that there are misleading standards. For instance, 1 watt / 1 meter measurements aren't always what they seem. The standard recently changed. Technically, the result of putting 2.83V through 8 ohms is 1 watt. If you want to measure an honest 1 watt into 4 ohms, you must put in only 2V to get 1 watt. The current practice of using 2.83V as the standard output voltage regardless of impedance can produce misleading numbers because 2.83V into 4 ohms is 2 watts and 2.83V into 2 ohms is 4 watts. To be strictly accurate, I use the voltage required to produce 1 watt into the loudspeaker's nominal impedance to calculate its sensitivity but it isn't published because that information isn't relevant to the customer's use of a powered speaker. Strictly speaking, input sensitivity of a powered loudspeaker is adjustable via the input attenuator and is driven by a pre-amp output. While it is useful to test loudspeakers in an anechoic chamber because they isolate the loudspeaker and microphone from wind, weather and reflections, the purpose of the anechoic chamber is to simulate an uninterrupted acoustical field, in other words, outside, suspended above the ground far enough to be able to measure to the lowest operational frequency of the loudspeaker without the influence of reflections on the measurement. An anechoic chamber is an idealized environment in which to measure a loudspeaker, and one that can be used year-round in controlled conditions, but it isn't a natural environment. Loudspeakers developed and tested in anechoic chambers will never be used in such an ideal environment again. In addition to that, the environment is an attempt to simulate an outdoor measurement on a clear, windless day. For mid-high boxes, an anechoic chamber of sufficient size is possible, however an anechoic chamber will have a low-frequency limit at which the room is too small to not influence low-frequency measurements. Anechoic chamber measurements of subwoofers are very rare because to achieve anechoic conditions down to 20Hz you need to have an extremely large anechoic chamber, something the size of an aircraft hanger. That's why 1/2 space/ground plane measurements of subwoofers are very common. Full-space performance of subwoofers can be reasonably calculated by subtracting 6dB from the 1/2 space measurement. Our output and frequency response ratings do specify distance and conditions, such as 1 meter in half-space, aka ground plane. Since the subwoofers are most often used on the ground, the specifications tell you exactly what you will get with the subwoofer on the ground in a very large space or outdoors.\"",

      "htmlContent": "<p class=\"font-semibold text-white mt-4\">Q: Your specs look a little inflated. Why do you use non-standard sensitivity ratings? Like 1 watt / 1meter in an anechoic chamber? Looks like yours are rated on the floor, with no mention of the input level or amp power for said rating. Please elaborate. David Lee – \"Thanks for your question. I understand and encourage skepticism. I know that in this industry it can be difficult to know who to trust because there are a lot of inflated numbers out there. I'd be happy to clarify anything that appears to be unclear. The practice of using 1 watt at 1 meter is a hold-over from days gone by, when 1 watt was being made by a tube amp and bigger power was difficult to generate. The information it provides is relevant to determining a loudspeaker's sensitivity for comparison to other loudspeakers when each is driven by the same amp. The primary relevance of this is related to comparing passive loudspeakers to see which one would produce more SPL output at 1 watt input. From there one could calculate the theoretical maximum output given the power limit of the amplifier. This doesn't take into account issues like thermal compression, port turbulence, excursion limits or distortion, all of which are extremely low at 1 watt power levels. Because we sell powered loudspeakers, there is no need to reference the sensitivity of the loudspeaker independent of the amplifier, which is why the specific sensitivity at 2.83V into 8 ohms isn't part of the specifications. Our amplifiers, drivers and processing are matched for ultimate performance as a system. I've seen many specifications of sensitivity that, if you investigate them, reference output SPL at frequencies outside their intended operating band. I've often seen sensitivity and peak SPL numbers for subwoofers based on levels at 120, 160 or 200Hz, which is well outside the range I would consider using a \"subwoofer\". It's difficult to have honest numbers be competitive with inflated numbers. Marketing departments and the general public all want to see the biggest numbers possible. Big number for power amps encourage the use of \"peak\" watts specifications. Our subwoofer amps are rated on continuous RMS power. We don't even list peak power. People who know a little more can see the difference but it's still possible for people to be misled. Part of the problem is that there are misleading standards. For instance, 1 watt / 1 meter measurements aren't always what they seem. The standard recently changed. Technically, the result of putting 2.83V through 8 ohms is 1 watt. If you want to measure an honest 1 watt into 4 ohms, you must put in only 2V to get 1 watt. The current practice of using 2.83V as the standard output voltage regardless of impedance can produce misleading numbers because 2.83V into 4 ohms is 2 watts and 2.83V into 2 ohms is 4 watts. To be strictly accurate, I use the voltage required to produce 1 watt into the loudspeaker's nominal impedance to calculate its sensitivity but it isn't published because that information isn't relevant to the customer's use of a powered speaker. Strictly speaking, input sensitivity of a powered loudspeaker is adjustable via the input attenuator and is driven by a pre-amp output. While it is useful to test loudspeakers in an anechoic chamber because they isolate the loudspeaker and microphone from wind, weather and reflections, the purpose of the anechoic chamber is to simulate an uninterrupted acoustical field, in other words, outside, suspended above the ground far enough to be able to measure to the lowest operational frequency of the loudspeaker without the influence of reflections on the measurement. An anechoic chamber is an idealized environment in which to measure a loudspeaker, and one that can be used year-round in controlled conditions, but it isn't a natural environment. Loudspeakers developed and tested in anechoic chambers will never be used in such an ideal environment again. In addition to that, the environment is an attempt to simulate an outdoor measurement on a clear, windless day. For mid-high boxes, an anechoic chamber of sufficient size is possible, however an anechoic chamber will have a low-frequency limit at which the room is too small to not influence low-frequency measurements. Anechoic chamber measurements of subwoofers are very rare because to achieve anechoic conditions down to 20Hz you need to have an extremely large anechoic chamber, something the size of an aircraft hanger. That's why 1/2 space/ground plane measurements of subwoofers are very common. Full-space performance of subwoofers can be reasonably calculated by subtracting 6dB from the 1/2 space measurement. Our output and frequency response ratings do specify distance and conditions, such as 1 meter in half-space, aka ground plane. Since the subwoofers are most often used on the ground, the specifications tell you exactly what you will get with the subwoofer on the ground in a very large space or outdoors.\"</p>"

      "title": "HOLD FOR NOW Questions about amplification and specifications",
      "content": "(Customer Questions in Bold, David Lee answers plain text) So just to clarify it is extremely possible, specifically talking about subwoofers, when frequency spectrum and quality are similar between two products, it's possible that a 700w sub can have a dB output that's louder or just as loud with the same quality as a 2400w sub? If so, would that be shown on paper as the Max peak SPL? (Main point I'm getting at is if I run into a decision between buying a 700w speaker with 128dB @ 1m, and a 2400w speaker with 128dB @ 1m, the best decision would be go with the 700w speaker, or are there other factors that would make one better than the other?) There is always a trade-off of one kind or another. If there were two subwoofers that actually had identical frequency response characteristics and output characteristics and one of them achieved the performance with 700W and the other with 2400W it would be almost inevitable that the one using only 700W to achieve the output would be much larger. On the other hand, if the two were the same size and the only available comparison was the CLAIM of 128dB, it's not likely that they would both make good on their claim. Something is likely to turn out to be an exaggeration. 128dB from 700W? At what frequency? I'd be more inclined to believe the 128dB from 2400W from a subwoofer. At that point you would need to dig deeper into the specifications to find data that supported the claims. Is the 2400W referred to as \"peak\" power? Probably a red flag. Is the 700W referred to as RMS power? Probably more realistic if the two share a similar price. 700W RMS is often then called 1400W \"program\" and some companies might even stretch that to 2400W \"peak\". Look for the *asterisks*. That's where you find the fine print about how they got to those numbers. If both speakers can actually deliver 128dB and the specification of the amplifier is exaggerated in one case then you can start to see which company is more or less likely to be telling the truth in other areas. The question is, can they actually deliver the 128dB? The next place to look is at the 128dB specification. Does it specify whether that is a measured output or a calculated output? Is there a sensitivity specification? Does the sensitivity specification indicate the load impedance? If it does, you can calculate how much power would be required to reach the 128dB from the rated sensitivity. To achieve a calculated output of 128dB using 700W would require a sensitivity of 100dB at 1 meter with one watt. That's not impossible for a horn-loaded system or a double-18\" subwoofer but very unlikely for a direct radiating single 18\" subwoofer. To achieve a calculated output of 128dB using 2400W would require a sensitivity of 94.5dB, which is realistic for a single 18\" subwoofer. Measured output takes more factors into account. The factors that occur in the real world, such as heat, turbulence and friction. In order to achieve a measured output of 128dB with 2400W, the sensitivity of the loudspeaker would have to be closer to 96 or 97.5 dB at one meter with one watt, depending on how well the driver dissipates heat. This result requires a better quality driver and an amplifier that actually delivers every bit of the 2400W... And the speaker has to survive the testing. I see plenty of specifications that would almost certainly prove fatal to the speaker if anyone tried to achieve them in the real world. So which one would I buy? I would be inclined to believe that a single driver sub with a 2400W amp could produce 128dB. IF the amps are rated using the same method and the SPL and frequency responses were measured and specified exactly the same way, and they were the same price, etc., the 700W product would appear to be a superior design. On the other hand, if the 700W product is claiming 128dB peak and the 2400W product is claiming 128dB continuous, I would choose the 2400W product. 2) You mentioned \"One could build a ruthlessly efficient system that was 112dB at 1 watt but did nothing at 30Hz. One could also build a desperately inefficient system that had 60,000W of power that would move more air with the fans in the amps than with the speakers.\"Similar question to question #1, are you saying that the efficiency (output dB @ 1 m) and effectiveness (amount of Watts it takes to expend that dB at 1 m) is what a consumer should look at when figuring out what system to buy (assuming main goal is loudness and clarity). Efficiency in this case refers to the conversion efficiency from electrical watts to acoustical watts. Yes and no... I'm saying that you can't just look at electrical Watts and ignore the acoustical output that results from those watts. First let me clarify. Efficiency isn't just output dB @ 1 meter. It's necessary to include three factors, Sound Pressure Level (dB) Distance (1m) and input power (1W) The specification of XdB (SPL) measured at 1 meter with 1 Watt of input power, usually but not always 2.83V into 8 ohms ( aka 95dB 1W1M) This specification indicates the system \"Sensitivity\", from which we can calculate the system's conversion efficiency as a ratio or percent. i.e. 95dB @1w1m corresponds to a 2% conversion efficiency. While this is very surprising, why is it important, you may ask? Because if your electrical to acoustical conversion efficiency is 2%, the other 98% of the electrical energy (aka Watts) is converted to heat! And heat is what blows woofers. The higher your conversion efficiency, the less power your amplifier needs to deliver, the less heat you have to dissipate from the voice coil and the less current you need from the wall outlet. And a speaker with very low conversion efficiency will get a lot hotter when producing the same SPL as a speaker with a higher conversion efficiency, so there is a tendency for lower conversion efficiency speakers to burn/blow more easily if the demand is for high SPL. From a sound quality, clarity or product purchasing point of view, it isn't absolutely better or worse to have a high or low conversion efficiency on its own. It's something you have to consider in context. For instance, a standard 120V 20A outlet can supply a maximum of 2400W continuously. If a speaker \"A\" can produce 128dB with 2400W and speaker \"B\" can produce 133dB with 2400W, then you might want to consider speaker \"B\" if you need to double your output without requiring another circuit. On the other hand, if speaker \"B\" is too big to move, you're going to need another circuit. Amplifiers also have conversion efficiency specifications. If amplifier A produces 2000W and is 95% efficient it will require 2,100W to make the output. If amplifier B produces 2000W and is only 70% efficient, it will require 2850W to make 2000W of output. You can see where this may also be a factor to consider. But this is a conversation for another day... In the early days of loudspeaker development, loudspeaker efficiency was critical because the early tube amplifiers were only able to deliver Watts in the single digits. If your speaker system wasn't very efficient, you just wouldn't hear it. For most of the history of sound reproduction, amplification was the most expensive element of the system. It still is, but now the cost of the amplification is much lower, especially relative to the costs of drivers, materials, labor and shipping. The weight of the amplifiers has also gone down dramatically, making it a tiny percentage of the weight of a loudspeaker cabinet rather than the amps outweighing the speakers. As the cost of amplification went way down, the market moved to smaller, less efficient boxes using more power to make up for the reduced efficiency. This made the power and power handling specifications more relevant for comparisons. Once the herd had turned and headed in the direction of bigger power numbers, well, let's just they still haven't turned back. The real problem is that they ran off a cliff. The real problem is that in the madness of chasing the big numbers, the definition of a Watt coming from and amplifier got somewhat diluted. The methods by which amplifiers were rated for output power became vague and, to a large extent, misleading. Here's the definition of a Watt from Wikipedia: \"The Watt is defined as 1 joule per second and can be used to express the rate of energy conversion or transfer with respect to time.\" So 1 joule per second, blah blah, blah, with respect to TIME! There's the key part that got what I call \"creatively interpreted\". If one Watt is 1 joule per second, how many Watts will you use in 1/125th of a second? And if you cycle on and off 4 times in one second, making the duration of the \"on\" cycle 1/32nd of a second, how much power will you produce/use? 1 joule for 1/32nd of a second is 1/32nd of a Watt. Not officially, but what some amplifier makers want you to believe is that if they can produce a 98V spike for 1/125th of a second, and repeat that 1/125th of a second spike 32 times per second that they are providing 2400W. So, their claims are true for 1/125th of a second but in the long term, the continuous power available from a system rated that way is closer to 600W. You can effectively de-rate these amplifiers by frequency. 1/125th of a second is the cycle duration of 125Hz, so at 125Hz the amplifier can deliver full rated power for one cycle. After that, according to the specification method, it needs a 4-cycle break. At 250Hz, you get 2 cycles, at 500Hz, 4 cycles and at 1000Hz, 8 cycles etc. Going the other way it's not even that pretty. At 60Hz you have to de-rate by half, so 1200W and at 30Hz, you will have no more than 600W. In audio dynamics, a second is a long time, especially for acoustic instruments, but with keyboards and electronic instruments it's not uncommon to see a sustained bass note last well over a second. If your amp can't deliver for more than a few milliseconds, your subwoofers are going to sound gutless. The takeaway is that in order to have a loud, clear and reliable system you need good conversion efficiency and good power. You can't expect low conversion efficiency with big power to be reliable. You can't expect solid low frequency performance from exaggerated power claims. You can't expect extremely high conversion efficiencies from reasonably sized portable enclosures. You can't expect the powerful amplification and the top-quality components that are required to produce the desired results for the cheapest price. What you really need is a properly engineered solution that balances the demands of SPL, reliability, sound quality, depth, weight, cost and electrical consumption. What you want is a ruthlessly practical solution to the demand for excellence. 3) What else matters besides efficiency? See above! You said \"Efficiency is the ratio of work done to the effort expended. Watts are how we measure the effort expended and dB are how we measure the work done\". Does efficiency correlate to effectiveness? Not quite. See below. If I read that right, that means it takes less watts for a highly efficient system, to achieve the same dB, as a higher watt/lower efficient system does. That is correct. When comparing two speakers, when a customer's main goal is how well a sub will shake a building, the two things to look at are the efficiency (dB output @ 1 meter) (E.g. 93dB@1 m = 1% efficient; 96dB@1 m = 2% efficient) and peak watts the system has? Actually, if your goal is to shake a building, the most important things to look at are the frequency response and the peak SPL. You need high output at low frequencies. Nothing shakes a building like extremely low frequencies. The deeper the frequency response, the better. But don't look at -10dB figures. The -3dB figure is what you need to consider. Beyond that, many times I see response graphs that contradict the specifications. Look at the response graph. 30Hz is where you start to really shake buildings. You should look for subwoofers with a -3dB specification below 30Hz. And with high maximum continuous SPL. And make sure the high SPL number is measured. And make sure the high SPL number is IN BAND, in other words a subwoofer than will do 140dB is worthless if that 140dB is happening at 140Hz. You will never use a subwoofer at 140Hz, and if you did, you wouldn't be shaking the building, you'd be shaking your head. You explain the dB @ 1m with 1W, calculation very well. That shows how efficient a speaker can be, but then how do you add in the max speaker wattage? Do you take that efficiency rating and use it to compare speakers? (E.g I have two speakers with the same efficiency; one is speaker A is 100w and speaker B is 105watts. Does that mean speaker B will be louder since it has the same efficiency? The short answer to that is yes. The second part of the answer is that you won't notice the difference between 100W and 105W. You'll barely notice 150W. You'll notice 200W. The third part of the answer is to point out a technical distinction. You said \"speaker A is 100w and speaker B is 105w\"... Technically, the amplifier in A would be rated for 100W and the amplifier in B would be rated at 105W. Why is this relevant? Because loudspeakers (transducers) are rated for power HANDLING, not power. Their power handling rating is a measurement of heat dissipation capacity. It would have no influence on the output of the speaker. If speaker \"C\" had a 100W amplifier and a 200W (power handling) speaker it would be no louder than speaker \"D\" with a 100w amplifier and a 100W (power handling) speaker provided the sensitivities were the same. Speaker \"C\" would simply have excess thermal capacity, meaning it would probably last longer or prove to be harder to damage. For example: my old Alto Black 18\" subwoofer had 2400 Watts and it's Max peak SPL = 133dB @ 1 meter. Frequency = 27-160Hz Your ZV18 has 2400 Watts and it's Max peak SPL = ? Frequency = 21Hz - 95Hz The ZV18 is an extreme example. It's very inefficient in order to get very low. It's not a box that's even intended to get loud. It's not really a fair comparison for either box but it's an interesting exercise to see the extent of the differences. First of all you quote the specs for both but you missed some critical differences. This illustrates A: Why these companies use these misleading number and B: Exactly what you need to pay attention to when looking at spec sheets. Alto: 2400 watts is peak, only 1200 watts continuous. BASSBOSS: 2400 Watts continuous RMS. Thats already double the power. Alto: 27-160Hz. Those are their -10dB specifications. BASSBOSS 21-95Hz +-3dB. That difference will probably result in a 7dB advantage to the ZV18 at 27Hz. The Alto spec sheet says 133dB is the \"maximum peak\" SPL. Most companies specify peak SPL at 6dB higher than continuous, making the estimated continuous output of the Alto 127dB. BASSBOSS has the ZV18 maximum sustained SPL at 127dB and short-term peak output at 130dB. The questions you have to ask yourself are, at what frequency will the box achieve its maximum output? Which one is more likely to deliver the output that it promises? Which one will deliver the most output at the frequencies where I really want it? I would be very happy to subject an Alto Black 18 to the same tests as our boxes in order to get directly comparable data. I'm certain that the peak SPL will be measured at a higher frequency than any of our subs, probably cloe to their 140Hz upper limit. I fully expect that the peak SPL will also measure at a lower number when using the same extremely unforgiving test procedures we use on our boxes. The BASSBOSS response requires no EQ, no boosting the low end. I also noted that the specification you chose for the Alto was 27-160Hz, which is their -10dB claim. Their -3dB claim is 29-140Hz, which I also don't believe the box will be able to maintain at high output levels. The frequency response graph published in their spec sheet shows clear evidence that equalization is applied in order to achieve those response figures. The benefit of the boost evaporates as soon as the volume is turned up because either the amp will run out of power or the driver will run out of excursion. The Alto box looks like the perfect example of a paper tiger. Make all the numbers look good on paper so it looks like a tiger, and when you get it home it's really just a pussy-cat. 4) If the dB for the ZV18 is the same as the Alto Black, then that would theoretically mean that they are equally as efficient and effective, correct? Efficiency isn't the same thing as effectiveness. Efficiency can be defined and measured. (It could be specified at every frequency but we average to simplify.) Efficiency is like miles per gallon. A sports car and a mini van could get the same miles per gallon but knowing their miles per gallon spec won't tell you how effective the vehicle will be for taking kids to school or for carving through corners on country roads. Same efficiency, different effectiveness. Effectiveness is subjective, it implies effectiveness for a particular purpose. In order to compare effectiveness we would need a metric of measure or a definition. For example, the Alto is more effective as a budget-priced speaker. To answer which one is more effective as a subwoofer requires that we know what you want a subwoofer to do, what your definition of an effective subwoofer is. To get a good sense of which one is more effective at making deep bass, you could look at the published response graphs side-by-side and evaluate which one is likely to produce more and deeper bass. As a general rule, published response graphs will be provided for professional products and not available for products intended for consumers who will never look at the graph, nor understand it. There is no standard for publishing graphs so you have to pay attention to the frequency lines and the SPL lines and note the differences at clearly indicated points. 20Hz, 30Hz, 40Hz and so on. You could go so far as to re-draw them on the same scale. I've done that for some models that were not available to measure. It helps to be handy with graphics software or Excel if you're going to do this, or you can go really old-school and use grid paper and a pencil... The key, though, is to learn to smell/see the BS. When you've looked at enough graphs, you can tell a lot about what's going on. Look for the notes and asterisks about how the data is presented. Is it smoothed? Is it processed? How and where was it measured? Check the scale. How much detail can you see? How many dB per vertical section? 3? 5? 10? Those things make a HUGE difference in how the data is perceived. If the marketing department made or edited the graph, it could be made all about manipulating perception. You have to learn to see past the presentation and find the meaning. From what I can tell, specification sheets are a lot like online dating profiles. Everything is shown in the best possible light, from the best angle and with make-up or air-brushing applied. The genuinely hot products have less to hide, and they are harder to find. If you put them together would they sound any different in regards to ability to shake a building If I'm wrong, could you please educate me further? Like you said, it takes years to become an expert on this stuff, but I'm trying my best. If I'm right though, as someone who is going to try to promote and sell your product, what justifies the extra money being spent? Durability of the speaker assumed being nearly the same.

      "htmlContent": "<p class=\"text-gray-300\">(Customer Questions in Bold, David Lee answers plain text) So just to clarify it is extremely possible, specifically talking about subwoofers, when frequency spectrum and quality are similar between two products, it's possible that a 700w sub can have a dB output that's louder or just as loud with the same quality as a 2400w sub? If so, would that be shown on paper as the Max peak SPL? (Main point I'm getting at is if I run into a decision between buying a 700w speaker with 128dB @ 1m, and a 2400w speaker with 128dB @ 1m, the best decision would be go with the 700w speaker, or are there other factors that would make one better than the other?) There is always a trade-off of one kind or another. If there were two subwoofers that actually had identical frequency response characteristics and output characteristics and one of them achieved the performance with 700W and the other with 2400W it would be almost inevitable that the one using only 700W to achieve the output would be much larger. On the other hand, if the two were the same size and the only available comparison was the CLAIM of 128dB, it's not likely that they would both make good on their claim. Something is likely to turn out to be an exaggeration. 128dB from 700W? At what frequency? I'd be more inclined to believe the 128dB from 2400W from a subwoofer. At that point you would need to dig deeper into the specifications to find data that supported the claims. Is the 2400W referred to as \"peak\" power? Probably a red flag. Is the 700W referred to as RMS power? Probably more realistic if the two share a similar price. 700W RMS is often then called 1400W \"program\" and some companies might even stretch that to 2400W \"peak\". Look for the *asterisks*. That's where you find the fine print about how they got to those numbers. If both speakers can actually deliver 128dB and the specification of the amplifier is exaggerated in one case then you can start to see which company is more or less likely to be telling the truth in other areas. The question is, can they actually deliver the 128dB? The next place to look is at the 128dB specification. Does it specify whether that is a measured output or a calculated output? Is there a sensitivity specification? Does the sensitivity specification indicate the load impedance? If it does, you can calculate how much power would be required to reach the 128dB from the rated sensitivity. To achieve a calculated output of 128dB using 700W would require a sensitivity of 100dB at 1 meter with one watt. That's not impossible for a horn-loaded system or a double-18\" subwoofer but very unlikely for a direct radiating single 18\" subwoofer. To achieve a calculated output of 128dB using 2400W would require a sensitivity of 94.5dB, which is realistic for a single 18\" subwoofer. Measured output takes more factors into account. The factors that occur in the real world, such as heat, turbulence and friction. In order to achieve a measured output of 128dB with 2400W, the sensitivity of the loudspeaker would have to be closer to 96 or 97.5 dB at one meter with one watt, depending on how well the driver dissipates heat. This result requires a better quality driver and an amplifier that actually delivers every bit of the 2400W... And the speaker has to survive the testing. I see plenty of specifications that would almost certainly prove fatal to the speaker if anyone tried to achieve them in the real world. So which one would I buy? I would be inclined to believe that a single driver sub with a 2400W amp could produce 128dB. IF the amps are rated using the same method and the SPL and frequency responses were measured and specified exactly the same way, and they were the same price, etc., the 700W product would appear to be a superior design. On the other hand, if the 700W product is claiming 128dB peak and the 2400W product is claiming 128dB continuous, I would choose the 2400W product. 2) You mentioned \"One could build a ruthlessly efficient system that was 112dB at 1 watt but did nothing at 30Hz. One could also build a desperately inefficient system that had 60,000W of power that would move more air with the fans in the amps than with the speakers.\"Similar question to question #1, are you saying that the efficiency (output dB @ 1 m) and effectiveness (amount of Watts it takes to expend that dB at 1 m) is what a consumer should look at when figuring out what system to buy (assuming main goal is loudness and clarity). Efficiency in this case refers to the conversion efficiency from electrical watts to acoustical watts. Yes and no... I'm saying that you can't just look at electrical Watts and ignore the acoustical output that results from those watts. First let me clarify. Efficiency isn't just output dB @ 1 meter. It's necessary to include three factors, Sound Pressure Level (dB) Distance (1m) and input power (1W) The specification of XdB (SPL) measured at 1 meter with 1 Watt of input power, usually but not always 2.83V into 8 ohms ( aka 95dB 1W1M) This specification indicates the system \"Sensitivity\", from which we can calculate the system's conversion efficiency as a ratio or percent. i.e. 95dB @1w1m corresponds to a 2% conversion efficiency. While this is very surprising, why is it important, you may ask? Because if your electrical to acoustical conversion efficiency is 2%, the other 98% of the electrical energy (aka Watts) is converted to heat! And heat is what blows woofers. The higher your conversion efficiency, the less power your amplifier needs to deliver, the less heat you have to dissipate from the voice coil and the less current you need from the wall outlet. And a speaker with very low conversion efficiency will get a lot hotter when producing the same SPL as a speaker with a higher conversion efficiency, so there is a tendency for lower conversion efficiency speakers to burn/blow more easily if the demand is for high SPL. From a sound quality, clarity or product purchasing point of view, it isn't absolutely better or worse to have a high or low conversion efficiency on its own. It's something you have to consider in context. For instance, a standard 120V 20A outlet can supply a maximum of 2400W continuously. If a speaker \"A\" can produce 128dB with 2400W and speaker \"B\" can produce 133dB with 2400W, then you might want to consider speaker \"B\" if you need to double your output without requiring another circuit. On the other hand, if speaker \"B\" is too big to move, you're going to need another circuit. Amplifiers also have conversion efficiency specifications. If amplifier A produces 2000W and is 95% efficient it will require 2,100W to make the output. If amplifier B produces 2000W and is only 70% efficient, it will require 2850W to make 2000W of output. You can see where this may also be a factor to consider. But this is a conversation for another day... In the early days of loudspeaker development, loudspeaker efficiency was critical because the early tube amplifiers were only able to deliver Watts in the single digits. If your speaker system wasn't very efficient, you just wouldn't hear it. For most of the history of sound reproduction, amplification was the most expensive element of the system. It still is, but now the cost of the amplification is much lower, especially relative to the costs of drivers, materials, labor and shipping. The weight of the amplifiers has also gone down dramatically, making it a tiny percentage of the weight of a loudspeaker cabinet rather than the amps outweighing the speakers. As the cost of amplification went way down, the market moved to smaller, less efficient boxes using more power to make up for the reduced efficiency. This made the power and power handling specifications more relevant for comparisons. Once the herd had turned and headed in the direction of bigger power numbers, well, let's just they still haven't turned back. The real problem is that they ran off a cliff. The real problem is that in the madness of chasing the big numbers, the definition of a Watt coming from and amplifier got somewhat diluted. The methods by which amplifiers were rated for output power became vague and, to a large extent, misleading. Here's the definition of a Watt from Wikipedia: \"The Watt is defined as 1 joule per second and can be used to express the rate of energy conversion or transfer with respect to time.\" So 1 joule per second, blah blah, blah, with respect to TIME! There's the key part that got what I call \"creatively interpreted\". If one Watt is 1 joule per second, how many Watts will you use in 1/125th of a second? And if you cycle on and off 4 times in one second, making the duration of the \"on\" cycle 1/32nd of a second, how much power will you produce/use? 1 joule for 1/32nd of a second is 1/32nd of a Watt. Not officially, but what some amplifier makers want you to believe is that if they can produce a 98V spike for 1/125th of a second, and repeat that 1/125th of a second spike 32 times per second that they are providing 2400W. So, their claims are true for 1/125th of a second but in the long term, the continuous power available from a system rated that way is closer to 600W. You can effectively de-rate these amplifiers by frequency. 1/125th of a second is the cycle duration of 125Hz, so at 125Hz the amplifier can deliver full rated power for one cycle. After that, according to the specification method, it needs a 4-cycle break. At 250Hz, you get 2 cycles, at 500Hz, 4 cycles and at 1000Hz, 8 cycles etc. Going the other way it's not even that pretty. At 60Hz you have to de-rate by half, so 1200W and at 30Hz, you will have no more than 600W. In audio dynamics, a second is a long time, especially for acoustic instruments, but with keyboards and electronic instruments it's not uncommon to see a sustained bass note last well over a second. If your amp can't deliver for more than a few milliseconds, your subwoofers are going to sound gutless. The takeaway is that in order to have a loud, clear and reliable system you need good conversion efficiency and good power. You can't expect low conversion efficiency with big power to be reliable. You can't expect solid low frequency performance from exaggerated power claims. You can't expect extremely high conversion efficiencies from reasonably sized portable enclosures. You can't expect the powerful amplification and the top-quality components that are required to produce the desired results for the cheapest price. What you really need is a properly engineered solution that balances the demands of SPL, reliability, sound quality, depth, weight, cost and electrical consumption. What you want is a ruthlessly practical solution to the demand for excellence. 3) What else matters besides efficiency? See above! You said \"Efficiency is the ratio of work done to the effort expended. Watts are how we measure the effort expended and dB are how we measure the work done\". Does efficiency correlate to effectiveness? Not quite. See below. If I read that right, that means it takes less watts for a highly efficient system, to achieve the same dB, as a higher watt/lower efficient system does. That is correct. When comparing two speakers, when a customer's main goal is how well a sub will shake a building, the two things to look at are the efficiency (dB output @ 1 meter) (E.g. 93dB@1 m = 1% efficient; 96dB@1 m = 2% efficient) and peak watts the system has? Actually, if your goal is to shake a building, the most important things to look at are the frequency response and the peak SPL. You need high output at low frequencies. Nothing shakes a building like extremely low frequencies. The deeper the frequency response, the better. But don't look at -10dB figures. The -3dB figure is what you need to consider. Beyond that, many times I see response graphs that contradict the specifications. Look at the response graph. 30Hz is where you start to really shake buildings. You should look for subwoofers with a -3dB specification below 30Hz. And with high maximum continuous SPL. And make sure the high SPL number is measured. And make sure the high SPL number is IN BAND, in other words a subwoofer than will do 140dB is worthless if that 140dB is happening at 140Hz. You will never use a subwoofer at 140Hz, and if you did, you wouldn't be shaking the building, you'd be shaking your head. You explain the dB @ 1m with 1W, calculation very well. That shows how efficient a speaker can be, but then how do you add in the max speaker wattage? Do you take that efficiency rating and use it to compare speakers? (E.g I have two speakers with the same efficiency; one is speaker A is 100w and speaker B is 105watts. Does that mean speaker B will be louder since it has the same efficiency? The short answer to that is yes. The second part of the answer is that you won't notice the difference between 100W and 105W. You'll barely notice 150W. You'll notice 200W. The third part of the answer is to point out a technical distinction. You said \"speaker A is 100w and speaker B is 105w\"... Technically, the amplifier in A would be rated for 100W and the amplifier in B would be rated at 105W. Why is this relevant? Because loudspeakers (transducers) are rated for power HANDLING, not power. Their power handling rating is a measurement of heat dissipation capacity. It would have no influence on the output of the speaker. If speaker \"C\" had a 100W amplifier and a 200W (power handling) speaker it would be no louder than speaker \"D\" with a 100w amplifier and a 100W (power handling) speaker provided the sensitivities were the same. Speaker \"C\" would simply have excess thermal capacity, meaning it would probably last longer or prove to be harder to damage. For example: my old Alto Black 18\" subwoofer had 2400 Watts and it's Max peak SPL = 133dB @ 1 meter. Frequency = 27-160Hz Your ZV18 has 2400 Watts and it's Max peak SPL = ? Frequency = 21Hz - 95Hz The ZV18 is an extreme example. It's very inefficient in order to get very low. It's not a box that's even intended to get loud. It's not really a fair comparison for either box but it's an interesting exercise to see the extent of the differences. First of all you quote the specs for both but you missed some critical differences. This illustrates A: Why these companies use these misleading number and B: Exactly what you need to pay attention to when looking at spec sheets. Alto: 2400 watts is peak, only 1200 watts continuous. BASSBOSS: 2400 Watts continuous RMS. Thats already double the power. Alto: 27-160Hz. Those are their -10dB specifications. BASSBOSS 21-95Hz +-3dB. That difference will probably result in a 7dB advantage to the ZV18 at 27Hz. The Alto spec sheet says 133dB is the \"maximum peak\" SPL. Most companies specify peak SPL at 6dB higher than continuous, making the estimated continuous output of the Alto 127dB. BASSBOSS has the ZV18 maximum sustained SPL at 127dB and short-term peak output at 130dB. The questions you have to ask yourself are, at what frequency will the box achieve its maximum output? Which one is more likely to deliver the output that it promises? Which one will deliver the most output at the frequencies where I really want it? I would be very happy to subject an Alto Black 18 to the same tests as our boxes in order to get directly comparable data. I'm certain that the peak SPL will be measured at a higher frequency than any of our subs, probably cloe to their 140Hz upper limit. I fully expect that the peak SPL will also measure at a lower number when using the same extremely unforgiving test procedures we use on our boxes. The BASSBOSS response requires no EQ, no boosting the low end. I also noted that the specification you chose for the Alto was 27-160Hz, which is their -10dB claim. Their -3dB claim is 29-140Hz, which I also don't believe the box will be able to maintain at high output levels. The frequency response graph published in their spec sheet shows clear evidence that equalization is applied in order to achieve those response figures. The benefit of the boost evaporates as soon as the volume is turned up because either the amp will run out of power or the driver will run out of excursion. The Alto box looks like the perfect example of a paper tiger. Make all the numbers look good on paper so it looks like a tiger, and when you get it home it's really just a pussy-cat. 4) If the dB for the ZV18 is the same as the Alto Black, then that would theoretically mean that they are equally as efficient and effective, correct? Efficiency isn't the same thing as effectiveness. Efficiency can be defined and measured. (It could be specified at every frequency but we average to simplify.) Efficiency is like miles per gallon. A sports car and a mini van could get the same miles per gallon but knowing their miles per gallon spec won't tell you how effective the vehicle will be for taking kids to school or for carving through corners on country roads. Same efficiency, different effectiveness. Effectiveness is subjective, it implies effectiveness for a particular purpose. In order to compare effectiveness we would need a metric of measure or a definition. For example, the Alto is more effective as a budget-priced speaker. To answer which one is more effective as a subwoofer requires that we know what you want a subwoofer to do, what your definition of an effective subwoofer is. To get a good sense of which one is more effective at making deep bass, you could look at the published response graphs side-by-side and evaluate which one is likely to produce more and deeper bass. As a general rule, published response graphs will be provided for professional products and not available for products intended for consumers who will never look at the graph, nor understand it. There is no standard for publishing graphs so you have to pay attention to the frequency lines and the SPL lines and note the differences at clearly indicated points. 20Hz, 30Hz, 40Hz and so on. You could go so far as to re-draw them on the same scale. I've done that for some models that were not available to measure. It helps to be handy with graphics software or Excel if you're going to do this, or you can go really old-school and use grid paper and a pencil... The key, though, is to learn to smell/see the BS. When you've looked at enough graphs, you can tell a lot about what's going on. Look for the notes and asterisks about how the data is presented. Is it smoothed? Is it processed? How and where was it measured? Check the scale. How much detail can you see? How many dB per vertical section? 3? 5? 10? Those things make a HUGE difference in how the data is perceived. If the marketing department made or edited the graph, it could be made all about manipulating perception. You have to learn to see past the presentation and find the meaning. From what I can tell, specification sheets are a lot like online dating profiles. Everything is shown in the best possible light, from the best angle and with make-up or air-brushing applied. The genuinely hot products have less to hide, and they are harder to find. If you put them together would they sound any different in regards to ability to shake a building If I'm wrong, could you please educate me further? Like you said, it takes years to become an expert on this stuff, but I'm trying my best. If I'm right though, as someone who is going to try to promote and sell your product, what justifies the extra money being spent? Durability of the speaker assumed being nearly the same. As I said, the ZV18 is not the best example for comparison to the Alto unit. {Funny, BASS (low) boss -vs- Alto (high)} There would be a profound (pun intended) difference in how they shook a building.

      "content": "For more info, check out this video by David Lee on this topic. Gain Structure and Setting Your Levels How to set the levels of Subs and Tops to achieve balanced sound and safe operation in 6 easy steps 1) Set up your mixer and speakers with all power and signal cables appropriately connected. (OK, this is the hardest step.) 2) Power the speakers on and turn their levels to minimum. (All the way down.) 3) Pick a very loud song or set of songs to play and start the first one on your player. Check the input level on your mixer to ensure it's not being overdriven. Whenever possible, keep the input signal below clipping, below any distortion. Boss Tip: Listen for distortion in the tops speakers with their inputs at a very low level. This requires turning up the outputs of the mixer all the way, turning up the speakers until you can barely hear them, then adjusting the input level up until you hear distortion, then down until you hear no distortion. This is informative because if there is any audible distortion with the speaker's inputs at low levels, the distortion is being created before it's reaching the speakers. Obviously any distortion indicates something is being driven too hard and that situation will need to be addressed, usually by adjusting the input levels on a preceding device or within a software application. If you connect more than one mixer, as in a DJ controller and a secondary mixer, it's critical to follow this same procedure for both and follow the same rule: Keep the inputs from distorting! Overdriving or clipping inputs on secondary mixers is the most common cause of distortion and can cause damage to loudspeakers. It's a common mistake to run line-level outputs from DJ controllers into mic inputs on secondary mixing boards, with the result being the overdriving (aka clipping) of the mic-level inputs. In short, line-outputs should be connected to line-inputs, and sometimes adapters (XLR to 1/4\" TRS) or attenuators (aka pads) or new mixers, are called for. Whatever the case, keep it clean! 4) Now that you have verified there is no distortion on the inputs, with one of the test songs playing, turn the output of the mixer* up until the output meters read at the top of the range where you'll be using it. The specific labeling may vary between mixers. It's recommended to pick a level at which the color of the indicator LEDs changes and to have the higher level indicator just occasionally flashing. The level indicated by the color change will permit the operator to easily recognize when the limit is reached. *In case there is more than one, the \"mixer\" in this step refers to the device connected directly to the speakers; however it's necessary to complete all the previous steps on all the devices ahead of the final mixer first. 5) Turn up the input level of the first speaker until the \"limit\" LED illuminates. (This will be loud, so step 4A might be to warn the neighbors.) When using BASSBOSS gear exclusively, we recommend starting with the subs. If you don't have subs, or if you're using a different brand of subs, starting with a top is appropriate. Repeat with the remaining subs, if any, for one side of your system. Next, if possible, rotate the balance to the opposite side. If you don't have a balance control, disconnect the signal from the first side. Repeat for the second side. With this step completed, the mixer's output indicators are correlated to the speaker's output limits. In other words, when the mixer indicates signal above your chosen maximum, the system will be at its uncompressed limits. Pushing the mixer above that maximum will indicate that the system is being pushed above the level at which it begins to compress. That's the point at which sound quality begins to deteriorate. It may still get somewhat louder but it won't get better. (When using tops without subs, follow the procedure to Step 5.) 6) If you started with subs, with the sub(s) of one side on at the previously determined level, turn up the top on the same side until the sound is balanced to your liking. (If you started with tops, bring up the first sub to suit your taste.) Repeat this process for the other side. (Yes, your subs should be in stereo.) When using tops with one sub or small subs, most often the system will sound balanced when the tops are below the level at which the limit light would come on. This isn't certain because the relative level will vary according to tastes. The selected preset will also affect the level at which the limit light comes on. The more subs in use, the higher the tops level will need to be. In other words, it's possible to use more than one sub with each top, so to realize the full potential of your tops may require using more than one sub with each. When that's the case, the procedure is the same: Set the maximum level on the subs and then add level to the top cabinet until you get the balance you want. If the subs and tops reach their limits at the same time, the maximum output capacity of the system is matched to your tastes. Following this procedure, the levels should be left where they are. There should be no reason to change them unless a different mixer is used or a different combination of speakers is used. There is no reason to turn the levels down before disconnecting power from the speakers. It's always best to power the speakers off before powering off mixers and other audio equipment in the signal chain. It's also recommended to connect and power on all other audio equipment before powering on anything with an amplifier.

(This will be loud, so step 4A might be to warn the neighbors.) When using BASSBOSS gear exclusively, we recommend starting with the subs. If you don't have subs, or if you're using a different brand of subs, starting with a top is appropriate. Repeat with the remaining subs, if any, for one side of your system. Next, if possible, rotate the balance to the opposite side. If you don't have a balance control, disconnect the signal from the first side. Repeat for the second side. With this step completed, the mixer's output indicators are correlated to the speaker's output limits. In other words, when the mixer indicates signal above your chosen maximum, the system will be at its uncompressed limits. Pushing the mixer above that maximum will indicate that the system is being pushed above the level at which it begins to compress. That's the point at which sound quality begins to deteriorate. It may still get somewhat louder but it won't get better. (When using tops without subs, follow the procedure to Step 5.) 6) If you started with subs, with the sub(s) of one side on at the previously determined level, turn up the top on the same side until the sound is balanced to your liking. (If you started with tops, bring up the first sub to suit your taste.) Repeat this process for the other side. (Yes, your subs should be in stereo.) When using tops with one sub or small subs, most often the system will sound balanced when the tops are below the level at which the limit light would come on. This isn't certain because the relative level will vary according to tastes. The selected preset will also affect the level at which the limit light comes on. The more subs in use, the higher the tops level will need to be. In other words, it's possible to use more than one sub with each top, so to realize the full potential of your tops may require using more than one sub with each. When that's the case, the procedure is the same: Set the maximum level on the subs and then add level to the top cabinet until you get the balance you want. If the subs and tops reach their limits at the same time, the maximum output capacity of the system is matched to your tastes. Following this procedure, the levels should be left where they are. There should be no reason to change them unless a different mixer is used or a different combination of speakers is used. There is no reason to turn the levels down before disconnecting power from the speakers. It's always best to power the speakers off before powering off mixers and other audio equipment in the signal chain. It's also recommended to connect and power on all other audio equipment before powering on anything with an amplifier.

      "content": "Under normal, aka moderate use, a woofer can last a very long time. Decades, even. A lot of things can affect their lifespan, though. A woofer living in a relatively persistent rain of spilled drinks will not live as long as one kept in a nice, cool, dry environment. Gravity can also influence its life. If the cone moves vertically, there is more force pulling the woofer down, and that can eventually lead to the coil becoming offset in the gap. If the cone moves horizontally, it's much less likely for sagging to occur, but rotating the driver 180 degrees once a year would prevent any misalignment from happening over time. So what about extreme use? Woofer suspensions wear in a pattern similar to tire wear. The harder you drive them, the sooner they wear out. With intense usage, the suspension of a woofer (in a sub and also in a top) can soften and stretch over time. This happens very slowly with normal use, it's barely noticeable and barely measurable. (Comparison would have to be made with an identical new unit in the same environment with the same components and programming to detect the changes.) With intense use, this deteriorating happens much faster. Most surrounds and spiders are made out of cloth, and that cloth is pressed into shape (the ripples) using heat, and held in place by chemical and adhesive additives that are embedded during the pressing process, or added afterwards, or both. (The parallel here would be starch in a shirt.) The fibers in the cloth and the bonds in the adhesives break down over time, and the harder and more often they are stressed, the faster they lose their original shape and resilience. Eventually a woofer's resonance can fall below the range for which the cabinet is designed, and a slight loss of system sensitivity can be the result. The driver's average sensitivity doesn't change but it becomes mis-aligned with the cabinet's tuning. Usually the tell-tale symptom is that the driver(s) will start to bottom-out or \"pop\". Sometimes, before that starts to happen, slightly more distortion will be noticed, particularly from the drivers' surrounds, which become softened and may buckle under higher pressures where a new woofer's surround would not. Essentially the suspension components of the woofer are wearable parts, and as with tires and shock absorbers, they need to be replaced when they are worn out. There are 2 options to restore the performance to as-new. One is to re-cone the woofers. This is less certain because you're depending upon the skill of the person doing the labor, and their assurance that they have provided the original replacement parts, but it _sometimes_ is cheaper. The more certain way is to replace the woofer with a new one. Since the amplifiers have no moving parts, they are much more consistent over time, and when one is failing, it's usually very obvious. Replacing a woofer gives an old speaker a new lease on life, so rather than replacing the whole loudspeaker, maybe a new woofer is all you need. See Also: Do You Recommend Driver Recones?",

      "title": "How should I use BASSBOSS subs/tops with speakers from another manufacturer?",
      "content": "BASSBOSS subwoofers and tops are all programmed to be phase and time aligned with one another. When using a rig consisting of only BASSBOSS loudspeakers, one does not need to perform any additional alignment (except for delay in the case where one is co-locating different speakers). However, when pairing BASSBOSS loudspeakers with loudspeakers from additional manufacturers, there is no longer this guarantee since the processing done by each company will likely differ significantly. This article covers the scenarios when BASSBOSS loudspeakers are paired with non-BASSBOSS loudspeakers When it comes to pairing BASSBOSS loudspeakers with loudspeakers of another brand, there are several possible cases that come up: BASSBOSS subwoofers paired with tops from another brand (by far the most common scenario) BASSBOSS subwoofers paired with subwoofers from another brand BASSBOSS tops paired with subwoofers from another brand BASSBOSS tops paired with tops from another brand Each case brings its own challenges and has its own possible solutions. This article will go through each possibility in turn: 1. BASSBOSS Subwoofers + Non-BASSBOSS Tops The most common scenario we get asked about is how one can pair BASSBOSS subwoofers with tops from another brand, such as RCF or QSC. While one can use them together, there's a possibility for phase cancellations in the crossover region, where BASSBOSS and the non-BASSBOSS speakers play at the same frequencies. The first thing one can do to reduce the occurrence of this is to select presets and crossover frequencies that minimize the opportunity for problematic overlap. We recommend using a Linkwitz-Riley filter at 24dB per octave: use with preset that sets a lowpass filter at a given frequency on your BASSBOSS subs (Say 80Hz), and start with a highpass filter at the same frequency for your tops. If your tops have a fixed highpass frequency (such as 100Hz for some QSC speakers), you can start with a preset that sets the lowpass filter to 100Hz on your BASSBOSS sub(s). This will quarantine the potential problem areas (mostly) to the crossover region. BASSBOSS MK3-series subwoofers have presets with a 24dB/Octave Linkwitz-Riley filter, so no additional processing is needed for the subs. Most tops from other manufacturers have presets for a highpass filter, however these may not have the correct filter type and slope for a smooth transition. While this kind of alignment is usually \"good enough\" for many users, there is still a high likelihood that you will get an inconsistent response where your BASSBOSS and non-BASSBOSS loudspeakers are playing a nontrivial volume at the same frequency. To fix this, one must take a measurement and perform a phase alignment in the crossover regions. We recommend using a processor with the ability to add filters (in particular allpass filters, as well as highpass filters) to the subwoofer and top signal separately. We recommend running your subs without any processing, as the filter coefficients for subwoofers often can create large delays and other problems. Using external processing, especially high-Q filters at very low frequencies can irreversibly damage your BASSBOSS subwoofers, and these damages are out of warranty. All the processing for alignment should be done on the channel that goes to your non-BASSBOSS top loudspeakers. To do the alignment, one can use a free software such as SMAART or REW (Room EQ Wizard). Note that one does not need a specialized measurement microphone to do this as what matters is the relative phase offset between the sub and top. In essence, you can use a vocal mic like an SM58, through a measurement mic will make it easier to get an overall flat response. Start by turning of your top loudspeakers so only your subwoofer(s) are on, and take a measurement of the subwoofer(s) run with minimal processing and save this trace (for MK3 subwoofers, choose the preset you would like to start with; for MK1 and MK2 subwoofers, adjust the EXO knob to be where you want to set the cutoff. 80Hz is often a good starting point, but experiment with what sounds good). Then, switch your top loudspeaker you want to align to \"full range\" mode (no highpass filter on the box), turn it on and turn your subwoofer(s) off. You'll be aligning this trace to the one you took of just the subwoofer(s). Start by adjusting the gain of your top loudspeaker so the overlap between the is around the same level (at this point you can also add a desired \"tilt\" to your system by backing off the high end a few dB). Then use a 24dB/Octave highpass filter on your processor applied the top to take out the spectrum of the top's frequency response where the sub(s) are playing. Where this will be depends on the subwoofer cabinet and preset being used. Once the frequency response looks relatively flat with a measurement mic (or with whatever suitable tilt you would like with your system; many of our customers prefer a more bass-heavy response and this is of course welcome), align the phase trace so it overlaps with the phase trace of the subwoofer you already measured. Allpass filters are recommended as they will not change the frequency response, however you can also EQ the frequency response with shelves or bells as needed (just beware of boosting too much of the low end on a top as this can eat up your available headroom). Another tool you may need to use is delay - BASSBOSS subs have such little processing delay that to truly align your tops to your sub, you'll also need to add some delay to your BASSBOSS sub; you can apply delay to your MK3 BASSBOSS subs in ControlBASS. We recommend you save the final settings in your processor so you can recall them later. 2. BASSBOSS subwoofers + Non-BASSBOSS subwoofers Attempting to align BASSBOSS subwoofers with non BASSBOSS subwoofers often creates more problems than it solves. We have seen customers bring BASSBOSS subs into venues that had existing subs for extra low end support, and got better results when turning off the \"house\" subs due to the fact that the there were phase cancellations between the BASSBOSS and non-BASSBOSS subs. As a result, due to the unpredictable nature of combining different boxes with different amplification and processing, we do not ordinarily recommend pairing BASSBOSS subwoofers with non-BASSBOSS subwoofers. If it must be done, measurements must be taken and the steps are similar to above. We recommend applying the processing for alignment on your non-BASSBOSS subs. Begin by selecting suitable presets for your BASSBOSS subs, and take a measurement of just the BASSBOSS subs. Then, turn your BASSBOSS subs off, and turn the other subs you want to align your BASSBOSS subs to on. Here is where you want to can adjust the gain, delay, and filters to align the traces. You may also need to perform a phase inversion depending on how the box is wired. Since most other subwoofers do not have the LF Extension of BASSBOSS subs, pay special attention to where (and how) the frequency response of your non-BASSBOSS subs start to roll off. You may find that adjusting the highpass frequency of your non-BASSBOSS subwoofers helps in aligning the phase traces. 3. Non-BASSBOSS Subwoofers + BASSBOSS Tops: Aligning non-BASSBOSS subwoofers to BASSBOSS tops follows a procedure similar to the section \"1. BASSBOSS Subwoofers + Non-BASSBOSS Tops,\" except now you'll be performing processing on the BASSBOSS tops instead. The first thing one can do to reduce the occurrence of this is to select presets and crossover frequencies that minimize the opportunity for problematic overlap. We recommend using a Linkwitz-Riley filter at 24dB per octave: use with a lowpass filter at a given (say, 80Hz) frequency on your subs, and start with a preset on your BASSBOSS top that matches the frequency you chose with your top.

In essence, you can use a vocal mic like an SM58, through a measurement mic will make it easier to get an overall flat response. Start by taking a measurement of the subwoofer(s) run with no/minimal processing (ensure your top loudspeakers are off), and save this trace. Then, turn on your tops and turn off your subwoofers, switching your BASSBOSS tops to the largest frequency mode (this is usually Preset 1). If using different BASSBOSS tops together, choose the lowest highpass frequency shared across the different boxes; you can find the highpass frequencies for each preset in the manual for your loudspeaker. You'll be aligning this trace to the one you took of just the subwoofer(s). Start by adjusting the gain of your BASSBOSS top so the overlap between the is around the same level (at this point you can also add a desired \"tilt\" to your system by backing off the high end a few dB). Then use a 24dB/Octave highpass filter on the top to take out the spectrum of the top's frequency response where the sub is playing.

Note that you can apply delay to your MK3 BASSBOSS subs in ControlBASS. We recommend you save the final settings in your processor so you can recall them later. 4. Non-BASSBOSS Tops + BASSBOSS Tops: It is basically impossible to align a BASSBOSS Top with a non-BASSBOSS Top, and thus we do not recommend attempting to do this. In addition to the different processing applied to each top in the different DSPs and filter implementations, the physical size of each cabinet will quickly become larger than the wavelengths as the frequency increases. For instance, a 1kHz wave has a wavelength of 13.3 inches (34 cm), wider than most loudspeakers, which will create phase cancellations when putting multiple boxes together. Attempting to array BASSBOSS tops with non-BASSBOSS tops will create phase cancellations across the spectrum, which corresponds to dreaded comb filtering. This issue can become more pronounced as the frequency increases. You can, of course, use a BASSBOSS top with a non-BASSBOSS top, with one of them functioning as a delay or fill speaker - no additional processing is needed or recommended. However we do not recommend attempting to colocate BASSBOSS and non-BASSBOSS tops. If you need a wider coverage with more SPL, consider using 2x DV12s, which can be paired together in an inverted array that was specially designed for coherent summation using the DV12 Stack Bracket. We also sell the MFLA, a line array box designed to array and sum as well as possible, if more coverage and SPL are needed.",

Start by adjusting the gain of your BASSBOSS top so the overlap between the is around the same level (at this point you can also add a desired \"tilt\" to your system by backing off the high end a few dB). Then use a 24dB/Octave highpass filter on the top to take out the spectrum of the top's frequency response where the sub is playing. Where this will be depends on the subwoofer cabinet and preset being used. Once the frequency response looks relatively flat with a measurement mic (or with whatever suitable tilt you would like with your system; many of our customers prefer a more bass-heavy response and this is of course welcome), align the phase trace so it overlaps with the phase trace of the subwoofer(s) you already measured. Allpass filters are recommended as they will not change the frequency response, however you can also EQ the frequency response with shelves or bells as needed (just beware of boosting too much of the low end on a top as this can eat up your available headroom). Another tool you may need to use is delay - BASSBOSS tops have such little processing delay that to truly align them to your sub, you you may need to add some delay to your non-BASSBOSS top. Note that you can apply delay to your <strong class=\"text-white\">MK3</strong> BASSBOSS subs in ControlBASS. We recommend you save the final settings in your processor so you can recall them later. 4. Non-BASSBOSS Tops + BASSBOSS Tops: It is basically impossible to align a BASSBOSS Top with a non-BASSBOSS Top, and thus we do not recommend attempting to do this. In addition to the different processing applied to each top in the different DSPs and filter implementations, the physical size of each cabinet will quickly become larger than the wavelengths as the frequency increases. For instance, a 1kHz wave has a wavelength of 13.3 inches (34 cm), wider than most loudspeakers, which will create phase cancellations when putting multiple boxes together. Attempting to array BASSBOSS tops with non-BASSBOSS tops will create phase cancellations across the spectrum, which corresponds to dreaded comb filtering. This issue can become more pronounced as the frequency increases. You can, of course, use a BASSBOSS top with a non-BASSBOSS top, with one of them functioning as a delay or fill speaker - no additional processing is needed or recommended. However we do not recommend attempting to colocate BASSBOSS and non-BASSBOSS tops. If you need a wider coverage with more SPL, consider using 2x DV12s, which can be paired together in an inverted array that was specially designed for coherent summation using the <strong class=\"text-white\">DV12</strong> Stack Bracket. We also sell the <strong class=\"text-white\">MFLA</strong>, a line array box designed to array and sum as well as possible, if more coverage and SPL are needed.</p>"

      "content": "Q: Is there a formula to calculate SPL loss in relation to frequency? For example, if a subwoofer can produce 140 dB SPL at 30 Hz, how many dB would it produce at 23 Hz? Alternatively, is there a formula to determine how much lower you can go in Hz frequency by pairing multiple subwoofers? A: This is a subject that requires far more information than is made available through spec sheets. It is a subject that I’d love to pursue in a video or blog but it would be possible to test against only the speakers available at the test at the time. The limiting factors in loudspeaker performance are amplifier power, driver displacement (ie, cone area multiplied by excursion distance, aka vD) and the relative efficiency of the cabinet design at given frequencies. There are trade-offs. The phrase, “all other things being equal” comes up a lot, but between products, that’s essentially never going to happen. One can compare the same amplifier and driver in different cabinets but changing more than one element introduces too many variables to make the theoretical or even simulated comparisons relevant. They must be tested in situ, and comparing any two would provide very limited benefit, so many need to be compared, and that requires the commitment of a lot of time and money. Considering the initial meaning of volume, it’s essentially a synonym for displacement, and frequency defines of segments of time. So SPL is equated with volume, aka displacement. Frequency is the duration of time over which that volumetric displacement must be maintained. In digital terms, that’s on, off. In sinusoidal terms its rise-fall. Nevertheless, positive (and then negative) pressure must be maintained for twice as long to deliver 20Hz than 40Hz. (Or any 2:1 frequency ratio, of course) In order to provide the same pressure for twice the duration demands twice the displacement, but not just in one direction. It demands twice the displacement in both directions. Thus the ability of a piston of a given diameter (woofer cone) to deliver the same pressure an octave lower requires 4x the displacement, all other things being equal… The ability for that piston to achieve that displacement requires more power and more acceleration as well, so there’s more to add. This is where cabinet design comes into effect. If one is to design for maximum efficiency at a lower frequency, higher SPL can be achieved at that target frequency, usually with an increase in physical size, but inevitably there will be a loss of efficiency at higher frequencies. It’s possible to compensate for those upper frequency losses, but that also adds to the physical size, the complexity, the weight and the cost. Essentially, it comes down to personal preference as much as anything else. If you want deep bass, and you’re willing to pay the price to get it in terms of physical size, cost, or whatever the price may be, then you pay it. When you do, you have something rare and special because so few are willing to pay that price. \"Good enough\" is cheaper, and only those who appreciate the value are willing to pay the price. Interestingly, there is research being done about the tangible value of deeper bass now, and it seems to offer advantages in perceived value of items sold, in time spent in venues, in time spent dancing and in other areas such as perceived quality. That’s another subject, but I believe one worthy of discussion with any potential customers. I realize this doesn't exactly answer your question, but I hope it provides a… deeper understanding… of the subject. ;-)",

      "title": "Kraken Questions",
      "content": "Q 1. I've read many comments about the Kraken focusing on its power mainly, but there isn't much subjective information (impressions) about its performance compared to other subwoofers. Can I ask if the bass produced by a Kraken is more intense, faster, and more visceral than the best PA subwoofers on the market, and even HIFI subwoofers like the JL Gotham v2? Or is it just a more powerful output with more headroom? I'm already familiar with the specifications (which I must add are impressive), I'm asking this to know how the bass of a Kraken sounds and feels before purchasing it. Yes, it is more intense and more visceral than other subs. With deeper notes it feels like swimming in bass. At higher notes, the impact from one unit is eye-ball rattling. Q 2. Can the midbass of a Kraken be compared to that of an Ampeg 8x10? Or is it even better? In terms of punch, speed, transient peaks, dynamics, etc. I've never compared it to an Ampeg 8x10 but the general pattern is that an 8x10 cabinet doesn't have a crossover, so it will sound like an unprocessed full-range with a blown tweeter. Although the frequency response will be far from flat, (read as it will be peaky) its output will tend to slope upwards towards the sensitivity peak of the 10\" drivers. Although the 8x10 can get loud, it will have significantly less output below 100Hz and significantly more output above 100Hz until the 10\" drivers roll off somewhere in the upper midrange. The Kraken is a subwoofer, and although its output can be described as brutal and violent, without midrange and highs to accompany it, it could \"seem\" to lack impact in comparison to an 8x10. This is because the higher frequencies contribute to the impression of impact and speed. For a full comparison to an 8x10, you need to include a mid-high, at which point the comparison is chalk and cheese. Q 3. Considering the power of the Kraken is RMS and its bass extension (23Hz), I see a lot of potential for cinema applications. So, could I use a Kraken for a 50 to 100-person cinema room and get an IMAX-like experience? Have you ever played a movie with intense bass on the Kraken out of curiosity? Definitely, and we've played some movies on it and scared the living daylights out of folks! Close Encounters of the Third Kind is especially fun. ;) (Master and Commander, Battleship, Iron Man, the list goes on.) Q(s) 4. I've had many subwoofers for home use, and some perform very well at concert or reference level in movies, indoors of course, ranging from the Paradigm SUB 2, JL Gotham v2, JTR Captivator ulf4000, Rel n25 (I've sold most of them to keep trying subwoofers, it's addictive). Sometimes I throw crazy parties in my garden for hours (easily more than 6 or 8 hours), I just have to open the glass doors and turn my system towards the garden to play music. The problem is that most of my subwoofers get too hot when playing loud, trying to maintain 120dB, and none of them reached peaks of 130dB in deep bass (JTR Captivator and JL Gotham came close) outdoors, not to mention the coverage distance (very little). And they all seemed to be reaching their limit all the time. My question is... could I use a Kraken in my room? Or would that be too crazy? Crazy is a relative term. I have a Kraken in my office. I don't need to turn it up much, but you can definitely use it in a small space. For example, how linear is the Kraken? Does it sound equally good at low volume or does it need to play loud to get Kraken-level bass? The Kraken is very linear. The processing allows it to provide flat frequency response to remarkably high output levels. The very lowest frequencies compress out first due to limitations of excursion, port air flow and coil temperature. Thus its maximum output SPL capabilities rise as frequencies rise. This is common with all subs. The difference is how loud and how deep the capabilities of the Kraken are before it starts to compress. Kept to levels that aren't dangerous to your hearing, your building and your relationships with your neighbors, the Kraken sounds as smooth as cooked chocolate pudding with whipped cream. Not instant pudding. And not redi-whip, real heavy whipping cream. And obviously, being in my room, could a Kraken play lower? Maybe down to 15Hz? Or is it limited? The room dimensions combine to cause what's known as \"Cabin Gain\". Essentially a 12dB/octave rise in measured SPL at frequencies below its onset. This produces an effect that allows higher SPL to be measured in the room at lower frequencies than would be possible outside the room. The tuning frequency of the box ultimately limits the lowest frequency that can be produced safely at high SPL. Inside the cabin, (room) that frequency shifts very slightly lower, but, the SPL at that frequency shifts up significantly. (more significantly the smaller the room is) The lowest the cabinet can go still needs to be limited by the processing necessary to prevent damage when not in a small room, but its effective frequency response does extend lower when in a confined space. It won't be flat to 15Hz, no. It might make it to 19 or 18Hz, depending on how small the room is. And would a Kraken in my room perform close to one of those subwoofers I mentioned in terms of bass quality? No, a Kraken in your room risks structural damage. Just sayin. ;) Q 5. I see that the Kraken is efficient, does this mean it is also low distortion? Could I play a Kraken at very high volumes for hours without getting tired or feeling fatigue? Yes, but also no. Distortion increases exponentially with level, so having excess capability allows you to keep distortion to a minimum. This is the benefit of having an excessively capable box like the Kraken. Ultimately you will feel fatigue, but not because of anything related to distortion from the cabinet. It's just too intense. You can't stand it for very long and you'll need to back it off. In other words, high SPL is relative and this is likely to produce higher SPL than you're used to unless you're into very loud car audio systems. The effect is a bit unexpected. Very low frequencies at high SPL make your eardrums move much more than they are equipped to. If you haven't ever felt that, it's quite strange and it gets uncomfortable pretty quickly. The distortion, in this case, is essentially within your ears rather than from the cabinet. Another effect is that of intermodulation distortion. When the bass is so intense that it modulates the air pressure to the point that the mids and highs sound like they are playing from behind a fan. The mids and highs are not distorting themselves but the changes in the pressure of the air through which they are traveling affects their propagation and their perceived levels.",

Considering the power of the <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong> is RMS and its bass extension (23Hz), I see a lot of potential for cinema applications. So, could I use a <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong> for a 50 to 100-person cinema room and get an IMAX-like experience? Have you ever played a movie with intense bass on the <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong> out of curiosity? Definitely, and we've played some movies on it and scared the living daylights out of folks! Close Encounters of the Third Kind is especially fun. ;) (Master and Commander, Battleship, Iron Man, the list goes on.) Q(s) 4. I've had many subwoofers for home use, and some perform very well at concert or reference level in movies, indoors of course, ranging from the Paradigm SUB 2, JL Gotham v2, JTR Captivator ulf4000, Rel n25 (I've sold most of them to keep trying subwoofers, it's addictive). Sometimes I throw crazy parties in my garden for hours (easily more than 6 or 8 hours), I just have to open the glass doors and turn my system towards the garden to play music. The problem is that most of my subwoofers get too hot when playing loud, trying to maintain 120dB, and none of them reached peaks of 130dB in deep bass (JTR Captivator and JL Gotham came close) outdoors, not to mention the coverage distance (very little). And they all seemed to be reaching their limit all the time. My question is... could I use a <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong> in my room? Or would that be too crazy? Crazy is a relative term. I have a <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong> in my office. I don't need to turn it up much, but you can definitely use it in a small space. For example, how linear is the <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong>? Does it sound equally good at low volume or does it need to play loud to get <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong>-level bass? The <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong> is very linear. The processing allows it to provide flat frequency response to remarkably high output levels. The very lowest frequencies compress out first due to limitations of excursion, port air flow and coil temperature. Thus its maximum output SPL capabilities rise as frequencies rise. This is common with all subs. The difference is how loud and how deep the capabilities of the <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong> are before it starts to compress. Kept to levels that aren't dangerous to your hearing, your building and your relationships with your neighbors, the <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong> sounds as smooth as cooked chocolate pudding with whipped cream. Not instant pudding. And not redi-whip, real heavy whipping cream. And obviously, being in my room, could a <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong> play lower? Maybe down to 15Hz? Or is it limited? The room dimensions combine to cause what's known as \"Cabin Gain\". Essentially a 12dB/octave rise in measured SPL at frequencies below its onset. This produces an effect that allows higher SPL to be measured in the room at lower frequencies than would be possible outside the room. The tuning frequency of the box ultimately limits the lowest frequency that can be produced safely at high SPL. Inside the cabin, (room) that frequency shifts very slightly lower, but, the SPL at that frequency shifts up significantly. (more significantly the smaller the room is) The lowest the cabinet can go still needs to be limited by the processing necessary to prevent damage when not in a small room, but its effective frequency response does extend lower when in a confined space. It won't be flat to 15Hz, no. It might make it to 19 or 18Hz, depending on how small the room is. And would a <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong> in my room perform close to one of those subwoofers I mentioned in terms of bass quality? No, a <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong> in your room risks structural damage. Just sayin. ;) Q 5. I see that the <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong> is efficient, does this mean it is also low distortion? Could I play a <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong> at very high volumes for hours without getting tired or feeling fatigue? Yes, but also no. Distortion increases exponentially with level, so having excess capability allows you to keep distortion to a minimum. This is the benefit of having an excessively capable box like the <strong class=\"text-white\">Kraken</strong>. Ultimately you will feel fatigue, but not because of anything related to distortion from the cabinet. It's just too intense. You can't stand it for very long and you'll need to back it off. In other words, high SPL is relative and this is likely to produce higher SPL than you're used to unless you're into very loud car audio systems. The effect is a bit unexpected. Very low frequencies at high SPL make your eardrums move much more than they are equipped to. If you haven't ever felt that, it's quite strange and it gets uncomfortable pretty quickly. The distortion, in this case, is essentially within your ears rather than from the cabinet. Another effect is that of intermodulation distortion. When the bass is so intense that it modulates the air pressure to the point that the mids and highs sound like they are playing from behind a fan. The mids and highs are not distorting themselves but the changes in the pressure of the air through which they are traveling affects their propagation and their perceived levels.</p>"

      "content": "What are “true watts”? How are they defined? An actual, real-world power-use rating is impossible to determine and is also not relevant when comparing powered loudspeakers because powered loudspeakers are more than amplifiers in a wooden box, they are complete systems including transducers and all the necessary processing. (More on why that’s important later.) The “true watts” that the loudspeaker uses will change from millisecond to millisecond, from minute to minute and will be different for every moment in every song. Watts are a mathematical construct that represent the maximum potential energy that can be dissipated. The amplifiers produce Voltage that flows through the voice coils. The flow of energy is modulated by the impedance of the coils, which changes with frequency and heat. As the energy flows through the coils, the result is the production of electromotive force and heat. Loudspeakers are inefficient at converting electrical energy into kinetic energy, so the vast majority of the energy that is produced by amplifiers is wasted as heat. To consider the number of watts as the most important factor in choosing a loudspeaker system is akin to considering the number of calories as the most important factor in choosing a cough medicine. The most important thing to any intelligent person buying a loudspeaker isn’t how many watts the amplifiers are capable of producing, it’s how many dBSPL can be produced, over what range, by the efficient use of the available power. Let’s try another analogy. Knowing how many gallons of fuel will fit in the tank won’t tell you how fast or how far the vehicle will go. The mass of the vehicle, the aerodynamic profile of the vehicle, the power of the engine and the gearing will all influence how fast the vehicle will go. And there will be a trade-off to be made between how fast it will go and how far it will go. The relevance here is that the fuel in the tank represents potential energy and the power rating of an amplifier represents the power that it has the potential to deliver, not what it’s doing all the time. How that power is used makes a difference. And another one: Buying a powered loudspeaker is to buying a car as buying an amplifier is to buying a motor. If all you want is a motor, it’s fair to look at the horsepower, because you’re going to build a car, or a truck, around that motor. But when you’re buying a powered loudspeaker, you’re buying a complete system, more like buying a car or truck rather than just buying a motor. When buying a car, would the horsepower figure be the only one you’d look at? Or would there be other things worthy of consideration? Comfort? Handling? Top speed? Braking? Fuel mileage? Reliability? Prestige? Resale value? Passenger capacity? Cargo capacity? Let’s imagine that the amplifiers in the Makara could only produce 50 Watts. Now let’s imagine that the sound pressure levels and the frequency response of the Makara were unchanged by the fact that the amplifiers could only produce 50 Watts. What difference would it make to the performance of the loudspeaker? None. It does what it does, whether it does so with 50 Watts or 500 Watts or 5000 Watts or 50,000 Watts. When choosing an amplifier, knowing how many Watts it can produce cannot tell you how loud the sound system in which it’s used will play. How loud the system can be depends on the interaction of that amplifier with the loudspeakers to which it’s connected, as well as more other factors than I can list. The Makara, and all other powered loudspeakers, are complete systems, so it’s a far better plan to compare real-world performance, as in what the speakers sound like when listened to side-by-side, than what they look like on paper. Take a test-drive. The amplifiers in the Makara can produce 2500Watts each into 4-ohms bridged. Not for very long, but I’m told they can. I have not tested this claim because I cannot use more power than those amplifiers can produce unless I want to risk burning up the drivers. In other words, the output of the amplifiers is limited by the processing to below their maximum capability, which again renders their maximum power rating largely irrelevant. So, since I have more power than I need to drive the woofers to achieve their maximum SPL, then I have more than enough power regardless of what that number is when calculated in Watts. Nobody buys a loudspeaker to own a loudspeaker. You buy a loudspeaker, or many, because you want to fill a place with sound, with music, with energy. If you start with the result being a room full of people bouncing to the thickest deepest bass they have ever heard and work your way back and back and back, you’ll find that some higher or lower number of watts that each amplifier is potentially able to produce on a test bench is not going to make a difference to how they feel being carried along by the waves of bass. Because ultimately the watts are irrelevant. How you feel about how you’re making them feel is far more relevant.",

      "title": "Power Questions for Peak Power Pull needs edit and post",
      "content": "Q . - Originally the pulls on them noted to pull 9amps per Davids Makara intro video, and now looking at the new spec sheet it states a pull of 14amps on 120v. Is that metric based on a peak pull? Would the Makara need to be on its own circuit? Can it run to full power with a At212 on the same circuit? Does this mean it can only run on a 20amp circuit? A. 9A is the rating prescribed by industry regulations and represents the average draw based on standard testing with music or pink noise with 6dB crest factor, yielding the industry standard of 1/8 power or ~12% duty cycle. In other words, a long-term average based on average use patterns. This represents an average consumption of 1100W, which both the amps and drivers can sustain indefinitely. The 14A number is based on a shorter-term calculation related to the time/current curves of circuit breakers. In other words, for short durations of high intensity, the amps will draw more than 9A, Allowing for approximately 150% of average for those high-intensity periods, it’s better to calculate a 14A draw when setting up your power distribution when connecting multiple amps to the same breaker. With this additional margin, short-term peaks are less likely to trip a breaker. Also of note is that 20A breakers don’t trip after passing 21A for 1 second. Most can pass up to 40A for 1 second. And I say most because not all breakers are the same. Some trip at lower current because they are old, have been tripped often or are hot. Some trip at higher current because they are new or are cold. Allow 9A under normal circumstances. Allow for more under more extreme circumstances, whatever those circumstances are. Another way of thinking about it is to consider the 9A number for music played at levels that reach maximum output voltage for very brief dynamic peaks but never reach compression/limiting. The duty cycle increases as the dynamic range decreases, so the more the signal is compressed, the higher the average current draw over time. And finally, different music content, specifically even different songs with different notes, and different compression characteristics within their mastering, will change the nature of the current/power profile, so these numbers are far from absolute. In short, 9A is recommended for “normal use” and is the minimum that should be available. 14A allows extra capacity for those maximum-draw notes at maximum level, just to minimize the chance that a breaker will trip in one of those moments. A Makara can be on the same circuit with an AT212 without any cause for concern. Under normal circumstances, two Makaras and two AT212s can be on the same circuit because most of the time they aren’t drawing anything near their maximum. In addition, tops and subs tend to draw power at different moments, so, although their combined maximum may be greater than the circuit breaker rating, they won’t all be demanding maximum current at the same time. Current draw is correlated to output SPL and a reduction of 3dB represents a current demand drop of ~50%. In other words, you can run more speakers on a given circuit if they aren’t running at maximum level.",

      "content": "Q: How much does PredictBASS Cost to use? A: Nothing! PredictBASS is free to use. You can download it at bassboss.com/software Q: What can I use PredictBASS for? A: PredictBASS is primarily for our customers who want to understand how the placement of subwoofers affects the response at different spots around a room. Q: Who is PredictBASS for? A: PredictBASS is for DJs, Bands, Live Sound Engineers, and Production Companies who want to get a better understanding of how bass \"works\" in different spaces and how the placement of subwoofers affects the sound at various spots in the room. We hope our customers can use it to get a better understanding of how sound works, allowing them to position their BASSBOSS products for maximum physicality. Q: What platforms is PredictBASS available for? A: You can download PredictBASS for Mac and Windows computers. Q: What does PredictBASS simulate? A: PredictBASS simulates the frequency response from the direct sound of different sources and the reflected paths of lower frequencies. It does not calculate diffraction due to small openings like doorways which can act as a resonator. Q: Can I use PredictBASS for top speakers as well? A: No, currently PredictBASS only works for simulating low frequencies. We may look into simulating top boxes as well, but we have yet to announce it at this time. Q: Do I need to own BASSBOSS products to use PredictBASS? A: No, anyone can download the software free of charge. Q: Can I predict the response of speakers from another manufacturer in PredictBASS? A: Currently, only BASSBOSS products are available for simulation in PredictBASS. This is because we measured all our boxes under the same conditions to ensure they were consistent with our calculations. Because we do not have access to measurements under the same conditions, we cannot predict with accuracy how other manufacturers' boxes will interact with BASSBOSS products. However even if you are not using BASSBOSS products, you can still use PredictBASS to gain an intuition for how low frequencies work in a room and see how different placements of your subwoofers could sound. Q: How accurate is PredictBASS? A: PredictBASS is more accurate than most other sound prediction software because it calculates the direct paths of different sound sources, interactions between sources, and reflections from surfaces. However it is not 100% accurate, both due to the finite nature of any simulation, the nuances of a real space like the material of different walls, and the fact that we are not calculating diffraction (which is prohibitive computationally). Our goal is to give users suggestions of where they can place their speakers which is \"good enough\" to be helpful without spending hours rendering each frame. The accuracy of the simulation depends on some factors, from temperature and humidity to the number of people inside the room. Download PredictBASS at bassboss.com/software",

MKII amps use the powerCON Gray or Blue older style connectors. *Pre MKII sub amps did not have power-passthrough. This was an option added to some higher-end subs, and ultimately almost all MKII subs. The exception is the Kraken. Due to the Kraken already hitting the max current limit per amp, power pass-through is not available. The DiaMon and SV9 MKIIs also do not have power pass-through, although generally, they are an endpoint for power to them and not used in pairs for the same audio channel, so power can be passed to them, just not from them. For MK3 Subs & Tops, all of them have power pass-through except: MK3 DiaMon does not have power pass-through due to the size constraints of the heat sync and connector area. MK3 Krakens do not have power pass-through due to already being at max current levels per amp module. Direct Link to PDF can be found here, or downloaded in the PDF displayed below.

      "title": "Removing and Reinstalling a MK3 Amplifier Assembly",
      "content": "As part of a service ticket, we may ask you to remove or replace the amplifier assembly of your BASSBOSS MK3 loudspeaker. The amplifier assembly is the part of the loudspeaker that contains the metal heatsink on the back of the speaker, usually containing the input board, DSP, and amplifier module. It looks like this: What you need to remove the amplifier assembly: 3mm Allen/Hex Key (Can be a hand tool or a bit for an impact) Power Cable (optional) Steps to Remove a MK3 Amplifier Assembly 1. Place the cabinet on its front, so the grille is facing down and the heatsink is facing up. This will make removing the assembly much easier. 2. Remove the screws around the edge of the heatsink using a 3mm Allen (Hex) tool, shown below (note that your heatsink may look slightly different; Kraken and Krakatoa heatsinks are square and have 16 screws, double driver amps have 10 screws and are longer) 3. Gently lift the heatsink from the speaker cabinet. Be aware that the heatsink is designed to create a seal with the cabinet so it will require a bit of strength (If you are having trouble getting the heatsink off the cabinet, you can insert the True1 power connector and lock in in place. Applying upward force to the cable will give you a bit of leverage to get the heatsink out) 4. As you lift the heatsink, disconnect the wiring harness(es) by pressing on the white release tab and pulling the connector away from the module. The wiring harness connects the amplifier module to the driver(s), and can be located behind the ribbon wire. If your loudspeaker has more than one wiring harness, take note of which harness went to each connection (you can always take a picture to help you remember where to insert them in the future). Steps to Install a MK3 Amplifier Assembly 1. Place the cabinet on its front so the driver/grille is on the ground and the space where the slots in is facing up (this will make installing the heatsink much easier). 2. Attach the wiring harness(es) back to the amplifier, being sure it each clicks into place, by aligning the tab. There is only one direction it can lock into. 3. Gently place the amplifier assembly back into the cabinet so the screw holes of the assembly line up with those in the cabinet 4. Use a 3mm Allen/Hex tool to reattach the amplifier screws back to the cabinet. Make sure they are fairly tight so they do not rattle out during operation!

      "title": "Replacing protection lightbulbs in pre-2020 BASSBOSS subwoofers",
      "content": "If you see a light glowing inside your pre-2020 BASSBOSS subwoofer cabinets, don't panic! High-powered lamps are provided as a safety mechanism to keep the drivers alive, even if the system is being pushed really hard. Heavy-duty, vibration-resistant, 500W halogen lamps help to keep the voice coils safe. Excess electrical energy that could overheat the voice coils is absorbed and converted to heat and light by the lamps before that heat can get into the coil and blow the driver. Most of the time the lamps aren't even getting warm, so they are barely on and never noticed. But, all lamps do burn out eventually, even if they are barely ever on. As each lamp fails, the remainder will glow more brightly. The good news is that the ore of the lamps that fail, the safer your woofers are. And these lamps are a lot less expensive than woofers! To ensure the protection circuits were easy to service, we used readily-available, 118mm, R7S 500W 120V halogen lamps, which you can buy from most places that sell lamps or work lights (Home Depot, Lowe's, Harbor Freight, WalMart, Amazon, etc.) New lamps should last many more years, but give them a check every two years or so because some lamps last longer than others and some systems are pushed harder than others. And there’s no need to keep the lamps clean, BTW. They don’t get that hot in this application. Here's what you'll need and how to replace the lamps: Buy lightbulbs on Amazon or Home Depot. You can also find them at any hardware or lighting store. Tools: #2 Phillips or JIS screwdriver to remove the grilles (Not needed for VS21) Allen Wrench to remove the driver(s) or cover panel (Be sure to use the right size to avoid damaging the bolt heads) MkI woofers use 5/32\" drive for flat-head or 3/16\" for socket-head bolts. MK1 VS21 covers use 7/32\" drive MK2 woofers and VS21 cover panels both use 5mm drive Wire brush, or similar, to scrub any corrosion or carbonization from the lamp holders Recommended: Grease, such as marine grease or dielectric grease, to prevent corrosion and carbonization The lamps are located behind the drivers, so it's easiest to access them by removing the drivers. Here are the basic steps to make the procedure as easy as possible: Put the cabinet on its back Remove the grille-screws and remove the grille (VS21: Remove the cover panel and skip to step 4) Unbolt the driver and lift it out. Locate the lamp sockets. Most cabinets have them attached to the inner port walls. Carefully remove all the old lamps. The ends of the lamps can crack. Glass or ceramic shards may be present. Clean the contact tabs on both ends of the lamp sockets with a wire brush. Once they are clear of corrosion, etc., apply grease to the contact tabs. Also apply grease to both ends of the lamps. (You don't have to worry about touching the glass because they are never as hot as actual lights.) Insert the lamps into the sockets, one end first. The lamps are connected and held in place by the spring tension between the socket and the tube. The lamps should rotate smoothly when properly inserted. To check this, rotate the lamps, ie spin them on their contact axis between thumb and forefinger. To test the contacts, flip the cabinet onto its feet and connect power and signal to the amp. Short the red and black wires of one woofer together and play some bass into the sub's amp. If you are performing this procedure on a double-driver sub, test each side separately. All the lamps feeding those shorted wires should glow orange. (This will make the lamps HOT to the touch!) If any don't glow, note which ones and, when the rest cool, check that they are centered on the fixture and making contact. It may be necessary to remove more of the carbon build-up to get good contact. Repeat the signal test to confirm all lamps glow when their woofer wires are shorted. Disconnect the signal and power from the amp and flip the cabinet on its back again. While you have the drivers out, examine them for wear or damage. It's assumed that the woofers are working, but these examinations will give you some insight into their condition and life-expectancy. Check the cones, particularly where they join with the surrounds, to ensure they have not torn or separated Check the spiders, particularly where they attach to the coil-former, to ensure they have not torn or separated Check tinsel leads, particularly where they meet the cone, to ensure there is no evidence of burning or fatigue. If you observe any of the conditions listed above, you may choose to take this opportunity to replace badly-worn woofers before they fail in the field. If there are no signs of impending failure, it's time to put the woofers back in. Connect the wires to the woofers, red wires to red terminals, black wires to black terminals, of course! Set the woofers in place and re-insert the bolts, starting each bolt by hand to ensure the bolts don't cross-thread. Tighten the bolts in a star-pattern, similar to that used on wheel lug-nuts. Don't over-tighten. 4-5 foot-pounds is sufficient for T-nuts. Check the gasket tape and re-install the grille. (On VS21, check the gasket tape and re-install the front cover panel.)

      "title": "SSP118 vs DJ18S - Which Is Right For Me?",
      "content": "BASSBOSS makes two single 18\" subwoofers, the DJ18S and the SSP118 (plus the new Sublim8 system, which features an 18\" Subwoofer). Naturally many people want to know the difference between these products. Many will look at the spec sheet and notice that the SSP118 is louder, while the DJ18S appears to get deeper: The SSP118 is listed with a -3dB point at 30Hz and achieves 130dBSPL continuous. The DJ18S is listed with a -3dB point at 27Hz and achieves 127dBSPL continuous. In practice, however, these differences are small and have to do with differences in cabinet construction. The DJ18S and SSP118 have the same amplifier and the same driver, so which one is best for you comes down to the footprint you desire and whether you plan on expanding. The rest of this article explains more about the difference between the two. Much of what applies to the SSP118 also applies to the new Sublim8; you can read more about the Sublim8 here. History of the SSP118 and DJ18S The SSP118 was designed to be 1/2 of the SSP218, one of the first BASSBOSS (at the time BASSMAXX) products and still one of the best double-18\" cabinets on the market. This meant it could be easily moved around by mobile DJs and production teams who didn't have the space or manpower to move the larger box. The DJ18S was originally designed to be a more cost-effective version of the SSP118. It had less expensive handles and internal bracing so the entire cabinet could be constructed with a single sheet of baltic birch plywood. When it was designed, it was intended to have a cheaper driver to keep the cost down. However David Lee was not satisfied with the performance of the box, so upgrades were made. These upgrades (including upgrading the woofer to be the same as the one in the SSP118) closed the gap in pricing between the two boxes. The SSP118 vs DJ18S on Paper The design of the port in the DJ18S resulted in a box with a tonality that is slightly deeper than the SSP118. The DJ18S is listed with a -3dB point at 27Hz, while the SSP118 is listed with a -3dB point at 30Hz. The port design and internal bracing of the SSP118 (noice the SSP118 has four ports, two on the top and two on the bottom) cycles cool air that cools the driver, so it can be run at a higher SPL (Sound Pressure Level) for a longer period of time. 3dB corresponds to double the power, so even though the DJ18S is rated as \"deeper\", the extra power the SSP118 is capable of producing means it can actually produce more energy at 27Hz than the DJ18S can. If one was to EQ the SSP118, they could get a very similar response and sound pressure level to the DJ18S, though they would be giving up some of the SPL capacity the SSP118 has around 40Hz. The tuning and processing of the SSP118 prioritizes maximum SPL while still getting very deep. As a result, if one wants the \"loudest\" cabinet, the SSP118 is the real winner, especially if one plans to push the boxes to the absolute limit. The SSP118 vs DJ18S in Practice The price difference between the SSP118 and DJ18S really comes down to the amount of material and complexity in constructing the SSP118. It may help to think of the SSP118 as a \"premium\" cabinet, as it features the following: Rubber feet and inserts for easy stacking without needing Two handles per side for easy transport An optional wheel cart that does not require flipping the subwoofer for operation. Note that there is an optional wheel cart for older versions of the DJ18S. Current versions of the DJ18S have hardware that accepts casters that can be installed on the rear of the cabinet for easy transport. If you: Plan on pushing your subwoofers to their absolute limit Want a (vertically) lower-profile box Work in a production company where expandability and premium handles are a priority Want to operate your subwoofers on carts The SSP118 may be right for you. If you Are on a budget, and want the best \"bang for your buck\" low end per dollar spent Want a subwoofer with a smaller horizontal footprint Do not plan to stack your subs or expand your system vertically The DJ18S may be right for you In summary, both are some of the deepest and loudest 18\" subwoofers on the market. You can't go wrong with either! At BASSBOSS, we do not make inferior products.

The <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong> is listed with a -3dB point at 27Hz and achieves 127dBSPL continuous. In practice, however, these differences are small and have to do with differences in cabinet construction. The <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong> and <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> have the same amplifier and the same driver, so which one is best for you comes down to the footprint you desire and whether you plan on expanding. The rest of this article explains more about the difference between the two. Much of what applies to the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> also applies to the new Sublim8; you can read more about the Sublim8 here. History of the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> and <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong> The <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> was designed to be 1/2 of the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP218</strong>, one of the first BASSBOSS (at the time BASSMAXX) products and still one of the best double-18\" cabinets on the market. This meant it could be easily moved around by mobile DJs and production teams who didn't have the space or manpower to move the larger box. The <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong> was originally designed to be a more cost-effective version of the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong>. It had less expensive handles and internal bracing so the entire cabinet could be constructed with a single sheet of baltic birch plywood. When it was designed, it was intended to have a cheaper driver to keep the cost down. However David Lee was not satisfied with the performance of the box, so upgrades were made. These upgrades (including upgrading the woofer to be the same as the one in the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong>) closed the gap in pricing between the two boxes. The <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> vs <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong> on Paper The design of the port in the <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong> resulted in a box with a tonality that is slightly deeper than the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong>. The <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong> is listed with a -3dB point at 27Hz, while the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> is listed with a -3dB point at 30Hz. The port design and internal bracing of the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> (noice the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> has four ports, two on the top and two on the bottom) cycles cool air that cools the driver, so it can be run at a higher SPL (Sound Pressure Level) for a longer period of time. 3dB corresponds to double the power, so even though the <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong> is rated as \"deeper\", the extra power the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> is capable of producing means it can actually produce more energy at 27Hz than the <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong> can. If one was to EQ the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong>, they could get a very similar response and sound pressure level to the <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong>, though they would be giving up some of the SPL capacity the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> has around 40Hz. The tuning and processing of the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> prioritizes maximum SPL while still getting very deep. As a result, if one wants the \"loudest\" cabinet, the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> is the real winner, especially if one plans to push the boxes to the absolute limit. The <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> vs <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong> in Practice The price difference between the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> and <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong> really comes down to the amount of material and complexity in constructing the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong>. It may help to think of the <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> as a \"premium\" cabinet, as it features the following: Rubber feet and inserts for easy stacking without needing Two handles per side for easy transport An optional wheel cart that does not require flipping the subwoofer for operation. Note that there is an optional wheel cart for older versions of the <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong>. Current versions of the <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong> have hardware that accepts casters that can be installed on the rear of the cabinet for easy transport. If you: Plan on pushing your subwoofers to their absolute limit Want a (vertically) lower-profile box Work in a production company where expandability and premium handles are a priority Want to operate your subwoofers on carts The <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP118</strong> may be right for you. If you Are on a budget, and want the best \"bang for your buck\" low end per dollar spent Want a subwoofer with a smaller horizontal footprint Do not plan to stack your subs or expand your system vertically The <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong> may be right for you In summary, both are some of the deepest and loudest 18\" subwoofers on the market. You can't go wrong with either! At BASSBOSS, we do not make inferior products. <div class=\"mt-4 p-4 bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg\">\n      <p class=\"font-semibold text-bb-orange mb-2\">See Also:</p>\n      <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300\"><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-1 my-2\"><li>Sublim8 vs other BASSBOSS Products Why do the <strong class=\"text-white\">BB15</strong> and <strong class=\"text-white\">DJ18S</strong> have casters on the rear, while other subs have wheel carts?</li></ul></ul>\n    </div>"

      "title": "SSP118 vs JBL SRX818SP/SRX828SP",
      "content": "In frequency response terms, the JBL SRX828 performs almost identically to two SRX818, meaning it gives you the same frequency response with 6dB more output. The JBL SRX828 offers maximum continuous output of 134dB at 67Hz. That means peak output can be calculated to 140dB. The BASSBOSS SSP118 is competitive with the SRX828, offering almost equivalent output between 35 and 50Hz. The SRX828 offers more output above 50Hz and a bit more below 40Hz. This is to be expected from a double driver sub. The design is essentially two SRX818 boxes joined at the port side. The SRX828 will deliver a bit more very low bass at maximum output because it helps to have another 18\" cone to displace that air. At maximum level, the JBL offers 3dB more output at 30Hz, 2dB more output at 35Hz, 0.8dB more output at 40Hz, 0.3dB more output at 45Hz and 0.7dB more output at 50Hz. Above 50Hz the two lines diverge, with the JBL continuing higher and the SSP118 going lower. At 55Hz the JBL double-18 shows a 3dB advantage, at 60Hz it shows a 4.2dB advantage, at 65Hz it shows a 5.7dB advantage, which it holds through 90Hz. The SSP118 was designed to be a subwoofer, to deliver as much deep bass as possible from a relatively small, portable enclosure. The fact that is does an excellent job at this is evident in the fact that between 40 and 50Hz, it runs neck-and-neck with either a double 18\" subwoofer, or two single 18\"s. In either case, the JBL's are twice its size. The SSP118 offers better low bass performance than all competitors' similarly sized single 18\" subs that we've so far tested, and better than some that are much larger, including the Yorkville 21\". The JBL SRX828 double-18 is the first box tested to offer more low frequency output than the single-18\" SSP118. An important thing to consider that is demonstrated in the response graph is the sound \"character\". It's true that you can't hear a loudspeaker by looking at a response graph but you can get an indication of its character. These graphs can tell you a lot about what to expect in terms of \"sound quality\". You can determine where the energy is focused, what it does best and the overall balance across its spectrum. This does give you a good indication of what it's going to sound like. The words people use to describe these things vary but a high resolution frequency response measurement graph will tell you a lot about the \"character\" of a loudspeaker. Is the energy focused at the bottom end of the spectrum, in the middle, or at the top? What does it give up and where does it peak when you turn it up to the limit? Under normal operating conditions, the SSP118's energy is focused between 35 and 55Hz. What it gives up when it enters compression is some of the energy between 25 and 45Hz. When pushed to the limit, it peaks at 50Hz. The JBL SRX828's energy is focused between 47 and 83Hz. It gives up energy between 30 and 50Hz when it enters compression. When pushed to the limit, it peaks at 67Hz. At maximum output above 50Hz, the SSP118's output decreases where the SRX828's output increases. This gets into the area of design choices and philosophy. Both at maximum and below maximum, the SSP118's output decreases above 50Hz. This is a deliberate choice intended to give the SSP118 a full, rich tone, to make it sound big and deep. To give it a big and deep character, it could not be designed to also go as loud in the upper end of its range. This is necessary to allow the SSP118 to get as loud as possible as low as possible and, when it's turned up to the limit, to prevent it from changing character and sounding different. Thus, at any level the SSP118 has a \"deeper voice\" than either of the SRX boxes. In comparison to the SRX818, the SSP118 is deeper and louder. The SRX828 has a louder voice, but if you wanted to give the SRX828 a deeper voice, to match the tonality and balance of the SSP118, you would have to give up on much of the area where it is louder. So, if you like your bass deeper, the SSP118 will do very nearly everything the SRX828 will do from a box that's half the size. That said, the SRX828 is a good product for the price. Next we'll be testing it against our double 18\" subs, and we'll post that as soon as we have the testing done. BASSBOSS SSP118: 130dB continuous. 136dB peak. Peak output frequency: 50Hz JBL SRX828SP: 134dB continuous, 140dB peak. Peak output frequency: 67Hz On the subject of limits, if you do tend to run your system buried in the limiters and every bit of output is necessary, it might be tempting to consider the higher output SRX828. On the other hand, the BASSBOSS warranty covers your boxes for 6 years, your amps for 3 years and covers your woofers from defects in workmanship for 2 years. The JBL warranty covers the boxes for only 2 years and the amps for 3 years. See Also: SSP118 vs DJ18S - Which is Right For Me?",

      "content": "Does the Sublim8 come with covers and a cart? Yes, the Sublim8 includes 3x transport covers (one for the sub, one for the spacer, and one for the top section) and a wheel cart for transporting. The cover features velcro to keep the top and spacer from falling off when rolling the system Does the Sublim8 come in white? Yes, you can get the Sublim8 in black or white. How tall is the Sublim8 when assembled? With the included spacer, the Sublim8 is just under 9' tall (8 feet, 10 inches to be exact). We are also developing a shorter spacer that will make the overall height around 7' (with two of the shorter spacers, the overall height can also be made 8') How much does the Sublim8 weigh? The total Sublim8 weight is 173lbs: the sub weighs 115lbs, the top weighs 38lbs, and the spacer weighs 20 lbs. How big is the Sublim8 when on the cart? The dimensions of the sublim8 are 34\" x 37\" x 25.75\" (86.36 x 93.98 x 65.41 cm) when on the cart for transport. Do I have to assemble the Sublim8 horizontally and tip into position? (i.e. can I assemble the Sublim8 vertically?) While we recommend assembling the Sublim8 horizontally and tilting it into position (as the overall height of the unit allows maximum torque to be applied, minimizing the effort needed to assemble the unit), you can assemble the Sublim8 vertically as well. This works in scenarios where you do not have the space to assemble the unit horizontally. You can stand the sub up, place the spacer on and slide it in, and then place the top section in and slide it in, or you can first slide the spacer and top together, and then place the combined section on top of the sub using the handles. The former method works well when placing the Sublim8 next to a stage, while the latter prevents needing to slide the top section in at about 6' in the air. How is the Sublim8 compared to other BASSBOSS rigs? In essence, you should expect around the performance of 1x SSP118 and 1x DV12. The Sublim8 features the same compression driver and horn as the DV12, but its midrange consists of 2x 8\" drivers instead of the DV12's single 12\" driver. See Sublim8 vs other BASSBOSS Products for more details. Can I place the top section on the sub without the spacer, for shorter deployment? No, due to the space needed for the cable connectors, you cannot operate the unit with the top placed directly on the sub (with no spacer). We are making a shorter spacer for deployment with seated audiences and on stages, and are working on other accessories that will permit even an shorter total height. How does the Sublim8 keep from coming apart when in operation? When the cables (lighting and/or speaker) between the sub and top are connected, the connectors themselves prevent the Sublim8 pieces from sliding apart and falling down. If sound is coming out of the Sublim8, it will not come apart! As we like to say, \"if it's playin, it's stayin'\" Why is the Sublim8 so expensive? The Sublim8 features premium components: it is made of baltic birch plywood, features loudspeaker drivers with neodymium magnets and large voice coils, and includes a high power 4,000W amplifier. It also comes with covers and a transport cart, all of which increase the initial cost. The Sublim8 is a total turnkey system with premium sound quality and massive SPL. Unlike other column-style loudspeakers, there are no compromises with the Sublim8, and it shows when you hear it. The Sublim8 is a more cost-effective option than purchasing a comparable system like an SSP118 and DV12 before considering the cost of transport carts and covers. Furthermore, the additional space and effort saved using the Sublim8 as a lighting stand adds to the value. Every customer is different and it is up to them to decide whether it makes sense financially to purchase the Sublim8. Why is the Sublim8 only rated at 133dBSPL (when the Evolve 90 is rated at 134dBSPL)? At BASSBOSS, we are conservative with our specifications so they represent continuous, real-world values, not \"peak\" nonsense that the speaker can only do for a millisecond. One should know a bit how these numbers are arrived at when attempting to compare different speakers based on their specification sheets (i.e. is the number from an actual measurement or a theoretical value, was the measurement ground plane or free space, etc). Outside of an actual measurement, these numbers can be next to useless at determining what a speaker is capable of and which is louder. To be able to accurately compare the output level of the Sublim8 with other products, one should ideally take measurements of each product in the same location under the same conditions. For example, we have no idea how EV arrived at 134dBSPL for the Evolve 90, and have not gotten a chance to place a unit in front of a microphone to make a direct comparison.

      "content": "The BASSBOSS product lineup is expanding with the brand new Sublim8. This document explains the difference between the Sublim8 and other BASSBOSS setups. The Sublim8 is an entire system featuring an 18\" low frequency transducer, 2x 8\" mid frequency drivers, and a 3\" high frequency driver with a 120 x 20 line array waveguide. The Sublim8 provides similar SPL to an SSP118 and DV12 combined together. As a result, it will outperform the SPL of a system containing a DJ18S and DiaMon, or a BB15 and CCM. The main benefit of the Sublim8 is the narrow horizontal footprint, the column aesthetic, and easy setup. The Sublim8 Subwoofer vs the SSP118 and DJ18S The Sublim8's low frequency section is a single 18\" driver, so it will naturally draw comparisons to the DJ18S and SSP118. The Sublim8's subwoofer will perform similarly to a single SSP118, meaning it will get louder than a DJ18S (the SSP118 is a more \"premium\" cabinet than the DJ18S, with more robust handles and four ports that cycle cold and hot air so it can be run louder for longer periods of time). The Sublim8's subwoofer also contains four ports, and the configuration is similar to an SSP118 on its side. There are minor differences in the cabinet construction of the Sublim8 and SSP118, but in practice they are likely unnoticiable. There are some improvements found in the Sublim8 that are not present in the current generation of SSP118's, some of which translate into some SPL (sound pressure level) benefits. However, existing SSP118 owners should rest assured that their current cabinet is not obsolete, and performance will be similar, all things considered. SSP118 owners considering the Sublim8 are encouraged to add the Sublim8 (rather than replcing their SSP118 with a Sublim8), bringing along their SSP118s when they need extra low frequency performance. A single Sublim8's top section can easily keep up with at least 2 additional 18\" subwoofers (or a double 18\" cabinet like the SSP218 or ZV28), if not more, in addition to its own high output 18\" subwoofer. Compared to other BASSBOSS subwoofers, the Sublim8 subwoofer section will get much deeper and louder than a BB15, though it is a larger and heavier box. A VS21 will get deeper and louder than the Sublim8, however it is a larger and heavier box than the Sublim8's subwoofer section. The Sublim8's Top Section vs the DV12: The Sublim8 shares the same HF driver and horn found in the DV12, meaning it offers a wide 120 degree coverage angle and a narrow 20 degree pattern that prioritizes even coverage and intelligibility. The DV12 features a 4 degree downtilt due to the rhombus shape of the box, while the Sublim8 fires straight forward, with a nominal vertical coverage of 10 degrees up and 10 degrees down. This can lead to the perception of the Sublim8 throwing \"further,\" despite the drivers and horns being the same (DV12 owners who desire more \"throw\" should simply get the box up higher). The difference between the DV12 and Sublim8 comes down to the single 12\" driver in the DV12 and the dual 8\" drivers found in the Sublim8. While the DV12's 12\" driver does have more cone surface area, the driver choice itself plus the tuning of the box are designed for low frequency reproduction. In practice this means the Sublim8's top section will provide mid and high frequency performance similar to a DV12 in a higher-numbered preset, where SPL is maximized. The main benefit of the Sublim8 is its ease of setup with one person. A single person may struggle to lift a DV12 onto a speaker pole due to the boxes' weight, size, and handle position. The desired low frequency performance of the DV12 necessitated such a big and heavy box, however this size is unnecessary when using subwoofers, which is why the Sublim8 is able to achieve DV12-level SPL and sound quality in a much lighter and smaller package. Furthermore, the Sublim8's design means a single person can assemble the entire tower with minimal effort. What is best for me? Whether one should purchase a Sublim8 versus an SSP118 + DV12 comes down to one's priorities. All things considered, the Sublim8 is a more cost effective solution, especially as it includes the transport cart and covers, which need to be purchased separately for the SSP118 and DV12. However the SSP118 + DV12 is still a compelling option for many as well, and hence why both products can coexist peacefully. If you are someone who: Performs at weddings or churches where sightless and aesthetics are important (in particular Wedding DJs and Bands) Often sets up solo Wants an option in white Desires a turnkey solution with maximal output versus footprint You want an easy option for mounting a lighting fixture, without needing to bring truss totems The Sublim8 may be the right choice for you! If you are someone who: Wants the flexibility to mix and match top/sub boxes Desires the ability to array another pair of tops when necessary Are part of a large production or rental team where lifting a 63lb box onto a pole is not a problem A system consisting of an SSP118 and DV12 may be the right choice for you.

      "title": "Video | 2-way vs. 3-way speakers - Unveiling the pros and cons",
      "content": "Dive deep into the world of audio engineering as we unravel the ongoing debate surrounding the choice between 2-way and 3-way loudspeakers. What are the advantages of three-way versus two-way? And are there advantages to two-way versus three-way? Three-way speakers referred to how many crossover points there are between the division of labor, between the lows and the mids and highs. If it's a three-way speaker, there are two dividing points. So there's a highs section, a mid-section, and a lows section. In a two-way speaker, there's one dividing point, which means there's a highs section and a lows section. The significance of that is when you have a crossover, you have an inherent phase shift that happens with that crossover. So, you have a time offset for modern cutting edge stuff. You can to a certain extent compensate for that time offset with air filters, but ultimately you're shifting everything later, so you effectively increase the delay time to narrow the arrival window. One way of looking at that is imagining the train arriving in a station. When a train pulls into a station, does it arrive when the front gets there, when the middle gets there, or when the end gets there? Where do you count that arrival time? Because there is a period of time over which this sound will arrive because it's been divided up into these sections and because of the physics of the mass of the different drivers, they don't all arrive at the same time. So, they arrive over a period of time. When you have a three-way speaker, you have necessarily increased the amount of time, you've increased the length of the train to a certain extent so that it will take more time for the entirety of that signal waveform to process through the speaker and arrive at your ears with a two-way where you have a shorter train, you have the transition. The arrival times of the two sections are truncated, so you don't have as long of a window. This is the advantage and disadvantages with a two way versus a three-way loudspeaker system. The two-way system will allow you to deliver the sound that the complete waveform of the spectrum of the sounds over a tighter window or arrival window that's better from a point of view of phase smear, which is time smear. So, you have the theory of a more tighter focused image when it comes to imaging and such like, and your perception of the coherence of those signals. With the advent of air filters, you can, as I said, truncate the window, but you move the window further away. So, in effect, the train gets shorter, but it arrives into the station later. You cannot make it arrive any earlier because you can't shorten it from the back. You have to shorten it from the front and then it will arrive. So, you to a certain state can solve the problem of that extension of time that's required by the second crossover filter. But you don't solve it by having it arrive sooner. You solve it by having the whole thing arrive later. So that means increased latency for certain applications. It's critical not to have that long latency and it becomes more critical with other aspects of the signal chain that can add to that latency. So, if you need something that gives you immediate feedback, even you don't want to be extending that latency. When it comes to larger systems, you know, you can have too much, you can have the system be too late behind the performance on stage, it's live. You can have the feedback, or the monitoring be too late when it comes to the action that somebody is taking on stage, the returning information that they're using for reference can be too late. And so, it lags with them, and it can really throw off a performer if that arrival is late. It's like when you have been on the phone with somebody and there's an echo of your own voice. It's very disconcerting. It slows your speaking way down. It can really mess you up. So, to a lesser extent, you want you don't want that. To a lesser extent. That happens as you add latency. So, these are the advantages, disadvantages to just the nature of the crossover network. Another thing that comes into play is that these pieces all have different characteristics and they most often, if they're not coaxial, mounted, they have different points in space from which they radiate their sound. So, they're they increase the number of different paths. So, if you have a midrange, a high frequency and a low frequency laid out, when you're off axis to that side, you're going to have the arrival of the high frequency early. The midrange will be possibly behind the low frequency, depending on how far apart they are and so on. But when you're on the other side, you're going to have the midrange arriving first, low range, getting there basically in between and then the high frequencies arriving later. And again, that shifts when you center on axis and down. So, you have all these different factors that multiple drivers don't necessarily see, solve problems. Multiple ways don't solve problems. They create problems in the solution that they create for other problems. So, what's the advantage to a three-way loudspeaker versus a two-way loudspeaker? You're dividing the labor. You're giving each device, each transducer, a narrower scope of work. High frequency devices will usually be able to be crossed over a little bit higher, putting less low frequency demand on them. That can reduce the distortion components that they may be producing. A lot of times it can allow them to be lighter, faster and thereby extend into higher frequencies. Higher operation frequency ranges. The next thing is you. So now you have a dedicated midrange device that doesn't have to be too heavy because it's trying to do low frequency or so light that it needs to do high frequency. So, you have this dedicated device that does midrange, and the argument is, oh yeah, that can be a significant benefit because now your midrange, which is where your ears are most critically sensitive to arrival times and frequency shifts, is coming from a single device. If that transition to the high frequency device is high enough, then it doesn't interfere. But you get back to another problem, which is depending on the diameter of that device, you can start beaming frequencies. So, the transitions are forced to, within certain ranges, depending on what those devices are. And so, it's not just a simple matter of, yes, three way is better. You then have your transition to your low frequency device, which, you know, it gives you advantage so that you can theoretically have a three-way loudspeaker that produces more low frequency information because the low frequency devices are not required to make the midrange and vice versa. So, the midrange device isn't moving with so much amplitude that it causes intra modulation distortion. And the distortion factor again is lower. You concentrate the low frequency energy from the low frequency device, the distortion that occurs there doesn't influence the action of the mid frequency device. Now, the pressure waves and so on is still going to cause in your modulation distortion, but you're not dealing with the same causes of that inner modulation distortion. So again, divide and conquer. But again, you, you end up with compromises. So, you have different issues. One way to minimize the way those compromises are negatively impacted is to create a coaxial midrange and high frequency device. That means that the distance off axis in any given direction is the same from the high frequency centered and the mid frequency center. So, you have you don't have those multiple arrival issues when you have a coaxial mid and high. If you had a coaxial mid high low, you would again you'd have the ideal, which would be the perfect point source. The perfect point source. On the other hand, if you go to the extreme, it is infinitely small and it radiates in all directions equally with flat response. You know how that fantasy goes. But when you start adding dimension to create those things, then you start introducing other factors. The number of ways still has the same benefit in the sense that you can divide that labor, that low frequency, mid frequency, high frequency labor up into more component parts. You still get the time smear the additions that those additional crossovers make, but you don't get the physical offset when you have a coaxial mid high section. So, these are the ways that you can build them and mitigate the negative consequences of these different devices. From the point of view of what you're trying to create, you can narrow down the application to very specific benefits. When it comes to three-way versus two-way. But again, it is specific to the task at hand. Is it better not for everything. So, when you're looking at other things that are high sound pressure level in the midrange, you can create more sound pressure level with more devices. The problem with that, again, you get multiple rivals. So, it's that two-way simplicity. If you have two people lifting a box, let's say one person, that's one in one person, that's the other end. You can fairly well coordinate that. The two people can work together like the high frequency and the low frequency. They can work together. If you have three people lift in the same box, there's more to coordinate. They can potentially lift a heavier weight, but there's more to coordinate. And so, you have to make these things all work together. So, the more ways you have, the more ways you have to get, then things go wrong. Then so simple as better.",

What are the advantages of three-way versus two-way? And are there advantages to two-way versus three-way? Three-way speakers referred to how many crossover points there are between the division of labor, between the lows and the mids and highs. If it's a three-way speaker, there are two dividing points. So there's a highs section, a mid-section, and a lows section. In a two-way speaker, there's one dividing point, which means there's a highs section and a lows section. The significance of that is when you have a crossover, you have an inherent phase shift that happens with that crossover. So, you have a time offset for modern cutting edge stuff. You can to a certain extent compensate for that time offset with air filters, but ultimately you're shifting everything later, so you effectively increase the delay time to narrow the arrival window. One way of looking at that is imagining the train arriving in a station. When a train pulls into a station, does it arrive when the front gets there, when the middle gets there, or when the end gets there? Where do you count that arrival time? Because there is a period of time over which this sound will arrive because it's been divided up into these sections and because of the physics of the mass of the different drivers, they don't all arrive at the same time. So, they arrive over a period of time. When you have a three-way speaker, you have necessarily increased the amount of time, you've increased the length of the train to a certain extent so that it will take more time for the entirety of that signal waveform to process through the speaker and arrive at your ears with a two-way where you have a shorter train, you have the transition. The arrival times of the two sections are truncated, so you don't have as long of a window. This is the advantage and disadvantages with a two way versus a three-way loudspeaker system. The two-way system will allow you to deliver the sound that the complete waveform of the spectrum of the sounds over a tighter window or arrival window that's better from a point of view of phase smear, which is time smear. So, you have the theory of a more tighter focused image when it comes to imaging and such like, and your perception of the coherence of those signals. With the advent of air filters, you can, as I said, truncate the window, but you move the window further away. So, in effect, the train gets shorter, but it arrives into the station later. You cannot make it arrive any earlier because you can't shorten it from the back. You have to shorten it from the front and then it will arrive. So, you to a certain state can solve the problem of that extension of time that's required by the second crossover filter. But you don't solve it by having it arrive sooner. You solve it by having the whole thing arrive later. So that means increased latency for certain applications. It's critical not to have that long latency and it becomes more critical with other aspects of the signal chain that can add to that latency. So, if you need something that gives you immediate feedback, even you don't want to be extending that latency. When it comes to larger systems, you know, you can have too much, you can have the system be too late behind the performance on stage, it's live. You can have the feedback, or the monitoring be too late when it comes to the action that somebody is taking on stage, the returning information that they're using for reference can be too late. And so, it lags with them, and it can really throw off a performer if that arrival is late. It's like when you have been on the phone with somebody and there's an echo of your own voice. It's very disconcerting. It slows your speaking way down. It can really mess you up. So, to a lesser extent, you want you don't want that. To a lesser extent. That happens as you add latency. So, these are the advantages, disadvantages to just the nature of the crossover network. Another thing that comes into play is that these pieces all have different characteristics and they most often, if they're not coaxial, mounted, they have different points in space from which they radiate their sound. So, they're they increase the number of different paths. So, if you have a midrange, a high frequency and a low frequency laid out, when you're off axis to that side, you're going to have the arrival of the high frequency early. The midrange will be possibly behind the low frequency, depending on how far apart they are and so on. But when you're on the other side, you're going to have the midrange arriving first, low range, getting there basically in between and then the high frequencies arriving later. And again, that shifts when you center on axis and down. So, you have all these different factors that multiple drivers don't necessarily see, solve problems. Multiple ways don't solve problems. They create problems in the solution that they create for other problems. So, what's the advantage to a three-way loudspeaker versus a two-way loudspeaker? You're dividing the labor. You're giving each device, each transducer, a narrower scope of work. High frequency devices will usually be able to be crossed over a little bit higher, putting less low frequency demand on them. That can reduce the distortion components that they may be producing. A lot of times it can allow them to be lighter, faster and thereby extend into higher frequencies. Higher operation frequency ranges. The next thing is you. So now you have a dedicated midrange device that doesn't have to be too heavy because it's trying to do low frequency or so light that it needs to do high frequency. So, you have this dedicated device that does midrange, and the argument is, oh yeah, that can be a significant benefit because now your midrange, which is where your ears are most critically sensitive to arrival times and frequency shifts, is coming from a single device. If that transition to the high frequency device is high enough, then it doesn't interfere. But you get back to another problem, which is depending on the diameter of that device, you can start beaming frequencies. So, the transitions are forced to, within certain ranges, depending on what those devices are. And so, it's not just a simple matter of, yes, three way is better. You then have your transition to your low frequency device, which, you know, it gives you advantage so that you can theoretically have a three-way loudspeaker that produces more low frequency information because the low frequency devices are not required to make the midrange and vice versa. So, the midrange device isn't moving with so much amplitude that it causes intra modulation distortion. And the distortion factor again is lower. You concentrate the low frequency energy from the low frequency device, the distortion that occurs there doesn't influence the action of the mid frequency device. Now, the pressure waves and so on is still going to cause in your modulation distortion, but you're not dealing with the same causes of that inner modulation distortion. So again, divide and conquer. But again, you, you end up with compromises. So, you have different issues. One way to minimize the way those compromises are negatively impacted is to create a coaxial midrange and high frequency device. That means that the distance off axis in any given direction is the same from the high frequency centered and the mid frequency center. So, you have you don't have those multiple arrival issues when you have a coaxial mid and high. If you had a coaxial mid high low, you would again you'd have the ideal, which would be the perfect point source. The perfect point source. On the other hand, if you go to the extreme, it is infinitely small and it radiates in all directions equally with flat response. You know how that fantasy goes. But when you start adding dimension to create those things, then you start introducing other factors. The number of ways still has the same benefit in the sense that you can divide that labor, that low frequency, mid frequency, high frequency labor up into more component parts. You still get the time smear the additions that those additional crossovers make, but you don't get the physical offset when you have a coaxial mid high section. So, these are the ways that you can build them and mitigate the negative consequences of these different devices. From the point of view of what you're trying to create, you can narrow down the application to very specific benefits. When it comes to three-way versus two-way. But again, it is specific to the task at hand. Is it better not for everything. So, when you're looking at other things that are high sound pressure level in the midrange, you can create more sound pressure level with more devices. The problem with that, again, you get multiple rivals. So, it's that two-way simplicity. If you have two people lifting a box, let's say one person, that's one in one person, that's the other end. You can fairly well coordinate that. The two people can work together like the high frequency and the low frequency. They can work together. If you have three people lift in the same box, there's more to coordinate. They can potentially lift a heavier weight, but there's more to coordinate. And so, you have to make these things all work together. So, the more ways you have, the more ways you have to get, then things go wrong. Then so simple as better.</p>"

      "content": "Advantages and disadvantages of utilizing carts for subwoofer deployment, it is noted that while carts facilitate ease of movement, they may lead to potential sound pressure loss due to escape pathways. However, the impact of this loss diminishes with the increase in the number of cabinets used. Ultimately, the decision to utilize carts should be based on workload and convenience factors. What are the advantages and disadvantages of deploying subs on carts? Well, it would seem pretty obvious that having them on carts makes them much easier to move around, and that’s what carts are primarily for. But are there really significant negative consequences to having a sub on a cart when you're using it, when you're actually trying to produce sound with it? Every pathway through which sound pressure can escape is a potential pathway for it to go away from the direction that you want it to go. So a five-inch gap underneath a subwoofer is a potential loss pathway. It is measurable, it isn't that significant, and the more cabinets you bring to bear, the less of a significance it has. In reality, though, it really isn't down to sound pressure level at that point. It's down to workload. Do you want to be lifting and hauling subwoofers, some of them over 250 pounds? There’s no way around that. If you can roll them into a venue, lock the wheels, and use them on the cart, it has advantages that I think outweigh the disadvantages of that slight energy bleed underneath them. Some of those advantages include not having your subwoofers sitting directly on a potentially dirty or wet floor. Another advantage that some people don't consider is that when the subwoofer is sitting on its feet, it has that relatively direct coupling to the floor, which is not a bad thing. But if its mass isn't sufficient—like if you don’t have another one on top of it—it’s not really heavy enough. Then the movement of the cone, and the equal and opposite reaction that the cone’s movement has on the box, will cause it to walk or shift slightly depending on the floor’s angle or where the holes are. This happens less with a box on a cart because that slight give lets the wheels stay in contact with the ground, allowing the cabinet to shift ever so slightly. Yes, you bleed a little bit of energy there, but the boxes stay where you left them, and generally speaking, they’re cleaner and easier to move back out of the venue. From my point of view, I don’t mind deploying boxes on a cart. In a purist world, you could go to the trouble of taking them off the cart. If you are going to do that, you should also take a big cargo strap, put it underneath however many subs you're going to stack together, loop the strap over, and lash them all together so that they are all coupled as one mass. If you’re going to do that, you could do it with them on the cart. You still have that mass and that tiny little energy bleed path, but you’ve addressed most of the advantages of taking them off the cart. Visually, if you want them on the ground and you don’t want the visual of the cart and are willing to do the extra lifting, there are those advantages. Yes, they’re going to get more detritus on them, but that will wipe off. Some people will be concerned that having your subs on a cart will make them less loud due to this energy bleed. The challenge is that we’re not really that sensitive to hearing that difference. If you did a blind test where you were listening to a sub on a cart versus not on a cart, you’d be hard-pressed to hear the difference. You can measure it, but the larger the number of subs, the more directivity you get, and the less of a difference it makes. Also, where you place the microphone matters. If the box is on the cart and the microphone is on the ground, the added distance from the acoustical source to the microphone, plus that energy bleed gap, will make it measure slightly louder when the box is not on the cart, but it’s on its feet. The feet give you three-quarters of an inch of elevation, while the cart provides about five inches. Yes, that’s a significant difference in terms of gap, but if you move the microphone up to where the distance is the same, you’ll have a hard time measuring a significant difference. It’s a fraction of a decibel, and the audience generally isn’t going to notice. Is it going to change the frequency response? Negligibly. It’s pretty much so many environmental factors will influence the difference from one venue to another that you won’t have a significant acoustic cost to having it on the cart compared to the workload and potential damage from lifting and moving. There are just so many other reasons why it might not be worth taking them off the cart. Everyone has their priorities—visual, aesthetic, or absolute performance. Personally, I’d rather have slightly more than I need and not be overly concerned with the absolute last tiny bit of performance from putting the box on the floor versus having it on the cart.",

But ultimately, the break-in time period isn't really going to make a huge amount of difference. Things that you do want to be aware of, whether it be initially when you first get it or even further down the road, are potentially maybe one of the reasons why people consider the break-in process as necessary. When you first power a woofer, it still has some curing to do. The adhesives do have some curing to do. So the one thing that is different with a woofer and an engine is that when you start adding heat to the voice coil in a woofer, it's going to finalize that sort of baking process of the adhesives that stick the whole thing together.

That's again, that's not a breaking thing. It's just the thermal shock. The pieces need to be able to expand and contract. They don't all do that at the same rate. Aluminum, steel, adhesives, copper—they don't all expand and contract at the same rate. The more rapidly you introduce that change, the more chance there is for there to be a problem, to create a problem with them expanding at different rates.

      "content": "In this video, BASSBOSS sits down with AM&S National Sales Manager, Samia Scoda, to discuss the importance of gain structure in professional audio systems. Gain structure refers to the proper balance of signal levels between various components in a sound system to ensure optimal performance and avoid distortion. Samia shares her expertise and practical tips for setting up gain structure in different settings. This video will provide you with valuable insights on how to achieve the best sound possible. Hi, I'm Samia with American Music & Sound and I'm here today at BASSBOSS to talk about gain structure. In today's conversation, I will navigate through setting virtual games and performance software, also setting gains and gain structure in your digital controller and mixer. And finally, we'll land on gain adjustment for your loudspeakers. And in the end, for power users, I'll show you how to do some unique routing to provide independent control of main speaker output versus subwoofer speaker output. As a DJ, I utilize Serato DJ Pro. In today's example, I'm going to be working off an older version of Serato, but the navigator and the adjustments will remain the same on occasion. When I load a new track into my library and then onto the virtual playing deck, Serato will do an analysis of key, BPM, and beat grid. One thing to pay attention to in the higher output sections of your track is a virtual gain view meter. Oftentimes those gains with auto gain set fall into the top of green, peak into the yellow, and it's a quality clear clean signal. In some cases, when I import a track, I notice that it will be at the top of the yellow, orange into the red. And that track you can hear audible distortion. With that in mind, one of my goals and how I look at my performances is about quality energy sound. And it's very important to start here with a clear, clean signal before it makes it to your hardware. I'm going to navigate through importing a track, playing that track, illustrating that view meter into a distortion red zone, and then how to correct that. Once corrected, that gain adjustment in the software will save like metadata. So the next time that the track is recalled, you'll be good to go. So let's dive right in and I'm going to load a track to the left-hand virtual deck of Serato. In this example, we're going to be focused on the view meter. And in order to get an accurate reading for doing a virtual gain adjustment, we want to navigate to a section of the track where the waveform is exhibiting some of its highest output. In this example, I have a cue point set. I will go ahead and navigate to that. I'll set a loop for eight bars and this allows a repeatable view of that particular output, which will also be helpful when we do hardware level gain adjustment. I will go ahead and play. And now that the track is running, I'm looking at the view meters in the virtual gain right here. If you follow my cursor, we'll make an adjustment with this knob right here by bringing it counterclockwise and you'll notice I brought it down substantially. I'm going to bring it back up until the Greens just start touching the orange and that's going to leave me some headroom for additional peaks and spikes that I may not be aware of in that particular piece of music. Once adjusted, I'll go ahead and stop the track and I will eject it. The reason for ejecting is I want to show you how it actually saves. So I'll go ahead and load that track one more time. I will navigate to that same cue point. I will initiate the track and you notice that the volume and the virtual gain are well in check. And it followed my adjustment. Now that this has been completed, we're able to move forward into our hardware and start with track level gain adjustment, master output gain adjustment before we go on to our loudspeaker. And now we're on our control surface. So our DJ hardware happens to be a four-channel controller. The center section is very similar to what you encounter in a mixer when you're stepping into any club venue and you're setting up either your own gear or coming on to existing gear. We'll go ahead and make sure that our mixer section is neutral. Each channel we will look at the cues, bring those to their zero point, their 12:00 position. I like to bring my levels down on all four decks. We have our up faders in the down position right now. I have the cross fader neutralized. That will have zero impact now on our gain settings. Pitch faders are zeroed out, my sections are turned off, the master gain is at zero or turned all the way down and both outputs and alternate zone outputs are also turned out. We'll focus first on adjusting the level output for your first channel gain. We have the same track with the same four eight-bar loop playing in a high output section of the waveform. And now we'll go ahead and bring up the level adjustment on this particular channel until we hit our zero DB point. This particular mixer does not have labeling for the DB point, but the master view meter output does. So if you look at the positioning, it's uniform. So the 0.4 the master output will be the same physical location for your channel. As I bring up the level, we'll see activity on the view meter for this particular channel and I'll continue to raise that channel until I finally see some action in the three six DB peak. But for me more or less a constant zero DB strike. Once I have that channel gain set to my liking, I'll go ahead and bring up the master. I'll take my fader and move it to the up position. You notice that we don't have any audio playing. We have the loudspeakers turned down fully and that will allow us to do our gain adjustments without contending with a loud environment. As we bring up our master gain, we'll see activity start to display on our view meter for our master out. We'll continue to raise that until we hit that zero point. I'm going to trim slightly on my first channel and I'm pretty happy with what I have engineered here. I prefer to come in at the zero point it allows me headroom physically here at the board, but also for variations in tracks. I have a lot of cushion. This will help maintain the best sound quality and also help protect the venue or your own system in order to unify your other channels for the evening. I'll go ahead as a starting point. I'll go ahead and gain out each one of these tracks. So it's as simple as loading that same track with the same loop in an instant double type format to your other decks. And we'll go ahead and make those same adjustments, bring up that meter, and we'll load it to our four deck. If you happen to have a four deck, you may as well get those dialed in and we will go over to our deck three and we'll bring that level up. Now you can look across your board and make sure you're unified. So all four channels on the same track essentially have the same channel level output. The other reason I like to target zero, especially on the master, when you bring in another track, the combination of the two tracks will likely boost the master output. So again, it leaves you a room for error or a buffer. Go ahead and pause those decks. I flip back to my primary again, my master set. I'll bring up a fader and there we are. Now we'll move on to our loudspeakers and show you my preferred method of setting the gains. And now we're here with two of my favorite speakers, the BASSBOSS SV and the BASSBOSS BB15. I absolutely love these because they are so easy to transport and they offer so much in terms of fidelity and output. This small package absolutely fills the room and does things that much larger speakers struggle to do without further ado, let's jump into signal routing and gain structure coming into the subwoofer. We have a feed from our controller that we saw earlier. We have an excellent loop out to our main power in power loop and we're ready to rock. We have the gains turned down. I'll start with a little bit on my mains and I'm going to increase gain output on the subwoofer until I reach the desired level for the venue at the maximum that I would like to play during the evening. So peak hours peak point generate that highest SPL that I'm shooting for. We'll start here a little bit of volume, go here, bring it to where you'd like come back to your main, add this mid and high until you find the balance that you would like for the type of evening that you're going to have. And you're done. So far. Advanced tips and tricks. I'm going to show you routing to be able to have discrete volume control of your subwoofer versus your main. I find it handy in certain events to have this level control. And if you're not deploying both monitors, you can use existing outputs on your DJ mixer controller to accomplish this task. If you're utilizing a board or a mixing console, you can utilize accents to separate these channels and have independent volume control. Some controllers even have an auxiliary zone output which will allow you to retain both monitors but also have discrete volume output in a differential. So in this example, again, I have routing into our subwoofer from our master output. I have routing into our main from our booth output. Independent control knobs allow me to vary that volume between sub and main any time I want and any bias I want during the course of the evening in an event.",

      "content": "The intricacies of powering your speakers effectively as we explore the differences between inverter-style generators and conventional generators. Loudspeaker systems exhibit varying current demands, characterized by peaks and valleys. Inverter-style generators, operating via capacitor banks, offer rapid power delivery, independent of generator speed. In contrast, conventional generators struggle to match the dynamic current draw of music, as their throttles constantly adjust to demand fluctuations. To determine the ideal generator size, consider the power ratings of your subwoofers for optimal performance. Hi, I'm David Lee from BASSBOSS. One of the questions we get a lot is what kind of generator does a person need to run their system? And the short answer to that question is an inverter style generator. The long answer to why an inverter style generator is basically because it's a much more stable power source for audio, particularly audio electronics, because they draw current in a peaking fashion. Because when the music peaks, when the bass hits, they draw a lot of current. And then when the music between the beats and between the bass hits, there's a valley and so they don't demand as much current. So the draw is very non-linear. Peak and then nothing, and then peak and then nothing, and an inverter style generator is more immune to that kind of cycling because it works by charging up a bank of capacitors, and capacitors can deliver power quickly, but they're not dependent upon the speed of the generator to get the voltage, and they're not dependent on the rotation. The RPM of the generator to get the frequency. So basically the generator runs by charging this bank of capacitors and then it has a 60 hertz sine wave generator that brings you your outputs. And when there's a big demand, it draws down on the capacitors, but it doesn't sag down the voltage, and it doesn't slow down the motor. And then when the draw stops, it doesn't then overrun because the throttle has been opened and you get a spike in voltage, and you also get an overrun in frequency. So it's much more stable. You get a nice 60 hertz sine wave and you get available power for these peaks and valleys. Conventional generators have the problem that they do react to how much current is being drawn off of them, and the throttle is constantly chasing the current draw demand. And usually it's not fast enough to keep up with the music. And so you end up with it bogging down when the bass hits, and then over-revving and over-voltage when you don't need it. And it just becomes a very messy situation that really limits how much output you can get out of a given power rating for a generator because it's rated for that power as a constant draw. And so if you turn on a motor, an air conditioner, a bunch of lights, they draw current, and the generator sort of reads that and goes, okay, I need to have this much throttle and that'll hold my RPM, my voltage. When you turn it off, when you turn the lights off, the generator will run high and then it'll come back again. But what's happening with sound is it's constantly going up and down, up and down. It's like on and off, on and off. So conventional generators really struggle. What happens is you ask it for current, it revs, and then it drops back when the note stops. But then when the next bass hit comes, it's low and it can't catch up in time. And so you can't get the full capacity of its rated output for the purpose of running audio systems. Short answer again, inverter style generator. Now, how do you know how big of an inverter style generator you need to be able to run your system? Essentially, you want to look at the subwoofer power ratings, and most of the time the power ratings for mid and high cabinets are very short-term duration draw requirements. The higher frequencies don't put a long enough duration of demand on the generator to pull its capacity down. But for current or voltage subwoofers, on the other hand, and the nature of bass notes, they last long enough that they do that. So look at the power in watts of your amplifiers, of your subwoofer amplifiers, and get a generator that is at least as much power in its rating as the total number of subwoofer amplifiers that you're going to be plugging into it. That's the simplest math you can do to get a relatively good combination of rating and output. The tops are going to draw a negligible amount. You want to have more if you can get it. If you can get more power than you need, it's always a good thing. You don't want to run into a situation where you're asking for too much from the generator because even an inverter style generator will brown out. I mean, it will pull it down to a point where it can't deliver enough voltage, and your equipment will go, I can't do this anymore, and it'll cut off. So those are the things that you need to watch out for. And the simple math of picking a generator to run a sound system. And the other thing that you've got to concern yourself with is, you know, why? Why is it more important, or what do you have to worry about when it comes to using a generator as compared to using grid power? Because when you go into a venue and you see a wall outlet, you can be fairly certain that that wall outlet will be able to provide you with 120 volts at 60 hertz and that it will have at least a 15 amp capacity because normally US wall outlet sockets are 15 amp rated. A lot of times the way the wall outlets are installed by virtue of the codes is that you can put multiple 15 amp sockets on a 20 amp circuit, and so many of the time that circuit breaker that's behind that set of outlets is a 20 amp breaker, and yet you'll still have 15 amp outlets. Point being that power is there. I mean, it's coming from the grid, and it's really generally at least here really stable. When you ask it to deliver more than 20 amps, more than 2400 watts on that plug, it can do that for a period of time. And the more you ask it for, the shorter the time it can do it for, based on when the breaker is going to trip. But the capacity of the grid is vast, and so a 20 amp breaker can give you 40 or 50 amps for brief moments. That way you can hit it really, really hard, get that big drum hit, and it won't trip the breaker. But if you're connected to a generator and its maximum output is, let's say, 20 amps, as you would think it was the same in terms of an outlet on a wall, it doesn't have that excess capacity that the grid has. So once you go over that 20 amp limit, the generator can't go to 30, 40, 50, 60 amps for that moment. It just sucks down the voltage, and that's why you have to be a little bit more concerned about how those ratings work out with generators. Then on grid power, it's just the fact that there is such a huge sort of storage capacity on the grid that if the power is there, you can draw honestly, you can draw 100 amps through a 20 amp breaker for a very short moment. It will trip. But if you do it very briefly, it won't. And, you know, if it's 50 amps, it'll be longer. If it's 40 amps, it'll be longer still, and so on. So you can definitely get 30 amps or 20 amp breaker for a period of time. Whereas on a generator, it just doesn't have that sort of excess capacity, that headroom that the grid has. So you have to be concerned that you don't ask or demand too much from a generator when running high-demand audio systems used.",

When you ask it to deliver more than 20 amps, more than 2400 watts on that plug, it can do that for a period of time. And the more you ask it for, the shorter the time it can do it for, based on when the breaker is going to trip. But the capacity of the grid is vast, and so a 20 amp breaker can give you 40 or 50 amps for brief moments. That way you can hit it really, really hard, get that big drum hit, and it won't trip the breaker. But if you're connected to a generator and its maximum output is, let's say, 20 amps, as you would think it was the same in terms of an outlet on a wall, it doesn't have that excess capacity that the grid has. So once you go over that 20 amp limit, the generator can't go to 30, 40, 50, 60 amps for that moment. It just sucks down the voltage, and that's why you have to be a little bit more concerned about how those ratings work out with generators. Then on grid power, it's just the fact that there is such a huge sort of storage capacity on the grid that if the power is there, you can draw honestly, you can draw 100 amps through a 20 amp breaker for a very short moment. It will trip. But if you do it very briefly, it won't. And, you know, if it's 50 amps, it'll be longer. If it's 40 amps, it'll be longer still, and so on. So you can definitely get 30 amps or 20 amp breaker for a period of time. Whereas on a generator, it just doesn't have that sort of excess capacity, that headroom that the grid has. So you have to be concerned that you don't ask or demand too much from a generator when running high-demand audio systems used.</p>"

In the context of picking the right system for your event, we come to the issue of headroom. So what is headroom and why do you need it? Headroom is a term that refers to the capacity above where you're using your system that exists so that it's not at the limit. How much excess capacity have you got between where your system needs to be to do the event and where it is at its absolute limit? If you plan your system to be at its absolute limit, there are negative consequences that a lot of things come into play that could be avoided if you had more capacity within your system. First of all, when you're pushing the system to its absolute limit, it will necessarily not last as long. I mean, you are working it at its hardest. All of the parts are moving at their limit. The thermal limits are there. All these things come into play and that's something that, you know, it'll eventually have a cost to a certain extent. Like the faster you drive, the faster you wear out your tires, the more gas you burn and the sooner you're going to need to do major overhauls on your engine. So having a fast car is great, driving it at its absolute limit is probably not going to keep it working that well. So what we want to do is we want to have some excess capacity. Another thing in the context of sound systems and headroom is that the closer you are to the absolute limit of that system, the less open space you have between the the the, the where you're operating it and its absolute limit. The more compressed and the more distortion you necessarily have. The percentage of distortion within a system is always lower when it's operating well below its absolute limit. Having headroom gives you cleaner sound, gives you a longer lasting system, gives you a better experience for the audience and so on. So how do you plan for that? Well, it's the same process as, you know, planning anything. But if you had the more headroom you have, the more capacity you have, the more capacity you have to while the audience for those moments when you want to do that and the less stress you're putting on your system. So why do you need headroom? You need headroom so that you're not running at the ragged edge and so that you can create moments with that excess power?

Learn the step-by-step process for maneuvering and stacking the ZV28 subwoofers with precision, ensuring max impact with minimum effort. I'm David Lee with Bassboss and we're here to illustrate how engineered these boxes to be easier to move and stack than you would think from looking at them. The way we engineered these to be able to be moved and put in place is so that you can flip them in and out of position. So as you can see, they roll into position. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to lock the wheels facing inwards. So whichever direction you need to go, you want the wheels facing that way. So that the axles are further from the end of the cabinet. And then you have to flip the box onto its back and you let it go down. Now the cart stays on there just by virtue of the friction with the feet, and then you can remove the cart, stand the box back up where you want it to be, and there you go back, but your top box on top and do whatever you need to do. They look intimidating, but you don't ever have to pick them up. It's a lot easier now. Let's put them back on the cart, locked wheels facing inwards and line up the feet and then tilt the cabinet up. So as you put weight on the cart, it'll grab the feet and you're ready to unlock those and roll. Now we're going to do stacking them. So you want to make sure the wheels are pointing inwards, away from the edge of the cabinet. So to do that, you just roll the cabinet a little bit in the direction that you're going to flip it. Okay. And then lock them up. That way it won't roll away from you. Now we'll see that even though I didn't bring all staff of folks to do this, it's not going to be the end of the world one handed.

Now you can also go straight from the box in a horizontal position onto a cart if you're tall, have long arms, or if you have a friend who can just hold that there, you can just go straight to as soon as you put tension on it, the wheel will stay. But if you're not tall or you don't have a friend, all you need to do is arrange some way of holding the cart on before you go to lifting, and then you can just lift.

      "title": "Video | Tackling ground loop noise",
      "content": "Delve into differentiating ground loop interference from feedback within sound systems. Effective strategies for combating ground loop noise include outlet verification, grounding devices lacking proper grounding, and ensuring all equipment shares a common ground source. By systematically disconnecting mixer connections, potential noise sources can be identified and resolved, crucial for achieving superior sound quality. Hi, I'm David Lee from BASSBOSS. And today we're going to talk about everybody's favorite subject, ground loop noise. First thing to understand is what's the difference between a ground loop and feedback? Feedback is a situation where the output of a system is looping back into it somewhere and it's creating a positive loop. In other words, what loops back in then gets amplified, is picked back up again, is amplified again, and that's where you get the runaway feedback. It requires the completion of that loop in the sense that you have to have an open microphone or something that's picking up the noise, maybe a turntable needle, some kind of instrument pickup, that kind of thing. So the sound coming into the environment is being picked up or vibration, whatever it is, being picked up, going back into the system and then being amplified. And that's feedback. Ground loops are different in that they don't loop and amplify and feedback. A ground loop is not a feedback loop. What it is that noise is a noise. Usually it's electrical. Hum. 60 Hz hum can be other noise, noise that's created by motors or dimmers or that kind of thing that can get into the electrical system. But the pattern is that that electrical field is being generated and it's being induced into the signal cable, so that the signal cable is then on its own picking up that noise and feeding it forward into whatever gear. Eventually gets to the amplifiers and loudspeakers. And that's where you hear it. While it's not specific information to chasing ground loops or eliminating them, there are some practices that you should follow as a general rule: connect everything in sequence from the last to the first, so you can track the wiring flow back to the source. Sometimes you'll find some gear, if it's not switched on, obviously not amplified gear, but front-end gear processors, things like that. If they're not powered up, if they don't have the power going to them, they will be more susceptible to noise once they're powered up. The noise can be eliminated. So don't chase ground loop noise on gear that hasn't been powered up yet. Wait until you got everything powered up. You want to power up your gear so that the last thing you actually turn on is the amplified gear. So the speakers or amplifiers need to go on last that way. Anything that makes a noise further up the signal chain won't make it to the speakers and make a pop. Now if you have a noise, if you have a ground loop, there are some things you don't want to do. The first thing you don't want to do is start to eliminate grounds. People have a long time used these little adapters that were originally made for adapting modern equipment to old houses that only had two-pin plugs in them. And so it has the proper use of it. It actually has the two pins and then a little tab that you're supposed to connect via the screw that holds the cover plate on to ground too that people use them to eliminate ground. Now, if we get rid of the ground, there won't be a ground loop. This is not a good idea because the ground is there as a safety mechanism in case something else is wrong. It prevents that power from backing up through you in particular. So don't eliminate grounds that are on pieces of gear that have it, and you're much better off adding ground to pieces of gear that don't have it than you are eliminating ground because grounds are there as a safety mechanism and they should be maintained. They're there, they're important. When they're working properly, they don't cause the noise. This noise is coming from somewhere else. So eliminating ground is a dangerous cheat and it's not a good plan. So how do you avoid ground loop noise? Step one, verify your outlets. It's just a good idea to do that. I mean, generally speaking, if it's the first time you're in a venue, it's worth it. You can get outlet checkers for anywhere between $5 and $45. So take your pick. They will tell you that you're good to go and you don't have so much to worry about. Generators also, if anybody's wiring up distros have one of those handy, a voltage meter is also a good thing to have, particularly with generators, because they do vary more than the grid. But an outlet checker will tell you that the things are wired the way they're supposed to be for your gear to be powered properly. In the simplest scenario, you have a speaker and a mixer and one cable going between them. And so there's your chain. So when you get to the mixer, you plug it in, the noise is there, what do you do? Well, generally speaking, a mixer has a bunch of other things connected to it, and if you disconnect each of those things in turn, if the noise stops when you unplug one of them, you know that it's coming in from the connection with that device. If you get through everything and you've got nothing connected to the mixer except for the speaker amplifier powered box and it's still humming, then the noise is being created between the points at which those two devices are connected to power. If one of those devices has a two-pin plug and the other one a three-pin plug, you can conceivably solve that problem by grounding the piece that has only a two-pin plug. When you do that, if the noise goes away, then you have solved the problem to the point that now you don't have that difference in potential between those two devices. Normally if you ground a device that isn't grounded, it will solve that problem if the problem is related to that ground loop. Now, it can happen that you have a mixer and a bunch of other pieces of gear that are collectively contributing noise, and you can sometimes simplify and eliminate that problem by connecting all of those devices to the same ground source, which is to say the same power strip, to the same extension cord, to the same whatever, so that you don't have multiple ground points because you could have a bad ground on a power strip. You could have any number of things that could happen when you start distributing that power out. So one thing that's just a good sort of practice to follow is to connect your mixer and all this stuff, all the light drawer stuff, which is to say your mixer, your wireless microphone receiver, your laptop, your whatever, or, you know, maybe like effects boxes and that kind of thing that you've got on your front end. Connect them all to the same power strip. They are never going to draw that much power. And so if you can connect them all to the same ground potential, it'll minimize the chances that they will pick up noise from being plugged into different circuits, different outlets. And I've seen it happen where noise has been eliminated just by moving things to the same ground point and permits done and the noise is gone. Instead of having to hunt down each individual thing and sort that problem out individually and grounding it, you can both process that and just go, here's this, you know, eight-outlet strip, put everything of these eight pieces of stuff that are in my front end into this one strip and everything there will have the same ground potential. It can solve some problems. It's not guaranteed if there's a fundamental problem in one of those pieces of gear. But it doesn't hurt to start there as a sort of standard practice. I always like the system to be so quiet that when it's on you, nobody even knows. And when you hit that first note, everybody's surprised. It bothers me. No. And to hear a system going, you know, whether it be a guitar amplifier or something that's just humming away in the background, it drives me crazy. So I find that it's important to work your way through these issues and understand what these things are, to keep that noise to an absolute minimum. And the biggest noise that you hear is the background minimum for noise of high-output amplifiers. And you don't hear them if you're having a conversation. So if we can all achieve that kind of signal-to-noise ratio, everybody's experience is just that much better.",

Ground loops are different in that they don't loop and amplify and feedback. A ground loop is not a feedback loop. What it is that noise is a noise. Usually it's electrical. Hum. 60 Hz hum can be other noise, noise that's created by motors or dimmers or that kind of thing that can get into the electrical system. But the pattern is that that electrical field is being generated and it's being induced into the signal cable, so that the signal cable is then on its own picking up that noise and feeding it forward into whatever gear. Eventually gets to the amplifiers and loudspeakers. And that's where you hear it. While it's not specific information to chasing ground loops or eliminating them, there are some practices that you should follow as a general rule: connect everything in sequence from the last to the first, so you can track the wiring flow back to the source. Sometimes you'll find some gear, if it's not switched on, obviously not amplified gear, but front-end gear processors, things like that. If they're not powered up, if they don't have the power going to them, they will be more susceptible to noise once they're powered up. The noise can be eliminated. So don't chase ground loop noise on gear that hasn't been powered up yet. Wait until you got everything powered up. You want to power up your gear so that the last thing you actually turn on is the amplified gear. So the speakers or amplifiers need to go on last that way. Anything that makes a noise further up the signal chain won't make it to the speakers and make a pop. Now if you have a noise, if you have a ground loop, there are some things you don't want to do. The first thing you don't want to do is start to eliminate grounds. People have a long time used these little adapters that were originally made for adapting modern equipment to old houses that only had two-pin plugs in them. And so it has the proper use of it. It actually has the two pins and then a little tab that you're supposed to connect via the screw that holds the cover plate on to ground too that people use them to eliminate ground. Now, if we get rid of the ground, there won't be a ground loop. This is not a good idea because the ground is there as a safety mechanism in case something else is wrong. It prevents that power from backing up through you in particular. So don't eliminate grounds that are on pieces of gear that have it, and you're much better off adding ground to pieces of gear that don't have it than you are eliminating ground because grounds are there as a safety mechanism and they should be maintained. They're there, they're important. When they're working properly, they don't cause the noise. This noise is coming from somewhere else. So eliminating ground is a dangerous cheat and it's not a good plan. So how do you avoid ground loop noise? Step one, verify your outlets. It's just a good idea to do that. I mean, generally speaking, if it's the first time you're in a venue, it's worth it. You can get outlet checkers for anywhere between $5 and $45. So take your pick. They will tell you that you're good to go and you don't have so much to worry about. Generators also, if anybody's wiring up distros have one of those handy, a voltage meter is also a good thing to have, particularly with generators, because they do vary more than the grid. But an outlet checker will tell you that the things are wired the way they're supposed to be for your gear to be powered properly. In the simplest scenario, you have a speaker and a mixer and one cable going between them. And so there's your chain. So when you get to the mixer, you plug it in, the noise is there, what do you do? Well, generally speaking, a mixer has a bunch of other things connected to it, and if you disconnect each of those things in turn, if the noise stops when you unplug one of them, you know that it's coming in from the connection with that device. If you get through everything and you've got nothing connected to the mixer except for the speaker amplifier powered box and it's still humming, then the noise is being created between the points at which those two devices are connected to power. If one of those devices has a two-pin plug and the other one a three-pin plug, you can conceivably solve that problem by grounding the piece that has only a two-pin plug. When you do that, if the noise goes away, then you have solved the problem to the point that now you don't have that difference in potential between those two devices. Normally if you ground a device that isn't grounded, it will solve that problem if the problem is related to that ground loop. Now, it can happen that you have a mixer and a bunch of other pieces of gear that are collectively contributing noise, and you can sometimes simplify and eliminate that problem by connecting all of those devices to the same ground source, which is to say the same power strip, to the same extension cord, to the same whatever, so that you don't have multiple ground points because you could have a bad ground on a power strip. You could have any number of things that could happen when you start distributing that power out. So one thing that's just a good sort of practice to follow is to connect your mixer and all this stuff, all the light drawer stuff, which is to say your mixer, your wireless microphone receiver, your laptop, your whatever, or, you know, maybe like effects boxes and that kind of thing that you've got on your front end. Connect them all to the same power strip. They are never going to draw that much power. And so if you can connect them all to the same ground potential, it'll minimize the chances that they will pick up noise from being plugged into different circuits, different outlets. And I've seen it happen where noise has been eliminated just by moving things to the same ground point and permits done and the noise is gone. Instead of having to hunt down each individual thing and sort that problem out individually and grounding it, you can both process that and just go, here's this, you know, eight-outlet strip, put everything of these eight pieces of stuff that are in my front end into this one strip and everything there will have the same ground potential. It can solve some problems. It's not guaranteed if there's a fundamental problem in one of those pieces of gear. But it doesn't hurt to start there as a sort of standard practice. I always like the system to be so quiet that when it's on you, nobody even knows. And when you hit that first note, everybody's surprised. It bothers me. No. And to hear a system going, you know, whether it be a guitar amplifier or something that's just humming away in the background, it drives me crazy. So I find that it's important to work your way through these issues and understand what these things are, to keep that noise to an absolute minimum. And the biggest noise that you hear is the background minimum for noise of high-output amplifiers. And you don't hear them if you're having a conversation. So if we can all achieve that kind of signal-to-noise ratio, everybody's experience is just that much better.</p>"

Learn why for many DJs an additional mixer might be unnecessary and potentially detrimental. Explore the scenarios where integrating multiple microphones, instruments, or sources may necessitate a mixer. Gain essential tips on navigating potential pitfalls, such as incompatible output levels between DJ mixers and band mixers, which can lead to distortion and compromised sound quality. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting, this video equips you with the knowledge to optimize your DJ setup with confidence. Hi, I'm David Lee, and I'm here to answer the question of whether you need a mixer in addition to your DJ board. In other words, do you need a band mixer in addition to a DJ mixer or DJ controller? This is primarily for DJs who need to integrate various things into their systems. There are some things you need to know and some things you need to avoid. So, the first question is: do you need one? Well, that depends on how you run your system. If you are the operator of the system and you’re in control of the levels, and you set it up as per our recommended method, realistically, no, you don’t need another board. More often than not, it will do more harm than good. We’ll go into why. Effectively, the boxes are programmed to be run straight from your mixing board, DJ board, or DJ controller, using the balanced signal going into the boxes. Realistically, you can use as many boxes as you like, daisy-chaining them as needed. This setup gives you all the control you need, under the circumstances, to balance the system the way you want it. When Do You Need a Mixer? Realistically, for the most part, you don’t. A mixer isn’t necessarily the right tool for the job in many circumstances. If you’re a DJ and need to bring in multiple microphones or different sources, or if you need to add instruments, then yes, you need a mixer to do that. The question then becomes: do you need it after your DJ controller or before your DJ controller? And how do you integrate those things together? Potential Issues with Adding a Mixer If you use a mixer after your DJ mixer or DJ controller before the loudspeaker system, be careful about what inputs you use. Your DJ controller or mixer has a line level output capacity. Most popular brands provide +24 dBu of output, which is way more than what you want going into a microphone input of a band mixer. Most inputs on a band mixer are microphone inputs, which means you can overdrive and distort them, negatively impacting the sound quality. To avoid that, make sure you're going into a line level input, which are often quarter-inch inputs rather than XLRs. If your mixer doesn’t have line level inputs, you can buy additional hardware, such as attenuators, that lower the level coming from the DJ mixer to prevent overloading sensitive microphone inputs. Digital Mixers and Sound Quality Another thing to watch out for is the filters and controls on both analog and particularly digital boards. If you’re using a digital board, there are so many settings and adjustments that can negatively impact the overall sound quality. We've had customers demonstrate this by plugging cables directly from their DJ board to the system, bypassing the band mixer, and the improvement in sound quality was remarkable. Alternatives to Adding a Mixer If you need to integrate multiple microphones or instruments and your DJ board lacks sufficient inputs or control, you might use a separate microphone mixer ahead of the DJ board. This setup allows you to mix and control microphones before they reach your DJ board. If your DJ board has line inputs, you can also connect the microphone mixer to these inputs, provided the mixer can output at microphone level. Conclusion What’s the best thing to put between your DJ controller and your sound system? Generally, it’s just a good quality signal cable. If you absolutely need secondary level control, we’ll provide some suggestions in the description below for alternatives to a full mixer. These alternatives might be better suited to your needs without compromising sound quality. Hopefully, these insights will help you improve the sound quality you provide as a DJ and manage everything else you need to do in the DJ realm.",

      "content": "Embark on a thorough educational exploration as David Lee delves into the intricate details of understanding the essential electrical requirements for effectively powering your BASSBOSS system. Gain invaluable insights to anticipate and address potential challenges such as electrical outages and fluctuations in output by thoroughly understanding your system's power needs and preparing accordingly. Hi, I'm David Lee from BASSBOSS. And today we're talking about the power requirements to run the various BASSBOSS systems and subwoofers. When you're running one of our big subwoofers, like the ZV28 or SSP218, we recommend that you have a 20 amp circuit for each cabinet. A 15 amp circuit will do because the 15 circuits will be enough power to run the sub. However, if you have a 20 amp circuit, you can also power additional top boxes. With that you can put a ZV28 and up to two of the AT212, DV 12, MFLA, or any of the smaller boxes on a single 20 amp circuit. Now, this is assuming that that circuit isn't being shared with a refrigerator, a fan, a moving headlight, that kind of thing. This is hopefully a dedicated 20 amp circuit for sound. You can actually run on less, but we always like to suggest that you have excess capacity for those extreme draw moments when you hit that special note, that really puts the strain on the system and you will be nowhere near any trouble. You'll be able to sustain your system's operation without tripping any breakers. If you do that for smaller subwoofers, the single driver subwoofers, which is SSP118, DJ18, BB15, and VS21, they can be run two on a 20 amp circuit, as well as those same tops that you can run with the double driver subwoofers. The amplifiers are roughly half the current draw of the big 4,000 watt amplifiers. So simply each driver is half of a 20 on breaker. The technical math is roughly half of that, so five amps for a single driver. So ten amps for a double driver sub is safe enough. But for those extreme system things, if you're really pushing your system, you'll want to have 20. We've never had issues when you have a 20 amp circuit available for a double driver sub. If you haven't got a whole lot of excess power, just get as close as you can. You'll, you'll, you'll be able to run on 10 to 15 amps for a double driver sub. But bear in mind that they are able to draw quite a bit momentarily, short, short term.. They have a current limiter in them. So all of the amps do. So they won't draw more than 16 and a half amps long term, so it will always pull back. That's why you can fairly well operate on a 15 amp circuit. But we, like I said, we suggest that you have a little extra. The tops are all relatively low draw so you don't have to concern yourself with adding one top or two tops with one or two subwoofers on a circuit. The Kraken is a special case. It is a four driver sub, which means it's set up to be connected to two 20 amp circuits. It has two 4,000 watt amps in it and in order to make it feasible to be connected in normally available circuits, even though the Cabinet won't fit into certain buildings that have those kinds of circuits, mostly if you do need to run it, you can. It's just easier to have two 20 amp circuits connected to the cabinet to power it than it is to demand that you have a 30 or bigger circuit available in every venue you go into. So that was a decision that was made just for the, for the simplicity of operation. Every two big woofers is one 20 amp circuit recommended.",

Now that all depends on the tops themselves and the subs as well, so there's no simple answer to that. But bear in mind that for every octave you lower your frequency target, you have to increase your effective output by four times. So in general, you should probably plan to have two subs for each top. Two appropriately sized subs to an appropriately sized top—two single 18s to a 12-inch two-way, two 18s to a double 12-inch two-way, etc. That gives you the ability to match the output levels that you get from the mid highs with the output levels that you want from the subs. People want more low frequency than they want from the tops, so they want more low end. People sometimes say, you know, a preponderance of bass or a haystack or something like that where they really want a boost in the low end. Since you have to create four times the displacement to match the sound pressure level one octave down and you want to increase output by, let's say, six dB, that's four times again. So that's 16 times more output to achieve the desired ratio of sound pressure level. And that isn’t usually done with one sub and one top.

Explore the innovative engineering behind subwoofer boxes and carts, designed to simplify the process. From smart rolling mechanisms to intuitive flipping and stacking methods, uncover the insider tips for smooth handling. Step-by-step procedure for transitioning boxes onto carts, securing wheels, and optimizing sound output placement. Hi, I'm David Lee, and I'm here to show you the easiest way to move and stack vs 21 subwoofers vs 20 ones or have a cart available for them. And if when you look closely, you will see the cart is slightly bigger than the cabinet, it protects it. In case you bump into something, the cart will hit first. So what you do is you lock the wheels on the cart with them facing inward way from the direction you're going to tilt the cabinet, and then you just tilt the cabinet onto its back and the cart will either fall away or you can hold it. When I say follow it, it'll pop off like that. Now you've got your cabinet on its back and all you have to do to get it ready to play is stand it back up again. Now if you're going to want to have two of these stacked on each other or at least horizontally, this one that I have here has what we call obviously bracket on it and vacillate bracket is the mechanism that we use to attach to the liners. And so this would be the box that you'd want on top. And I'm going to do the same thing here to tilt this box off. I can pretty much do it all from the back, prop the wheels off, stand it back down and line these two up and you see the patterns of the feet interlock. And the locking mechanism is just pockets so that there's not there's not a link that you have to make. But once they're touching each other, you basically just push. Then up they go and then you have a stack, the single person lifting them up like that, and you put your top boxes on top and you ready to do the show? On stacking them. It's pretty much the reverse. There tends to be a little bit of balance lift up on the bottom one. Once it's balanced, you walk around, push inwards, lower down, and now you're ready to put them back on their carts. So for a £180 box, we've done our best. Make them as easy as possible to make them convenient, to utilize even if you're a solo operator and you have to do it by yourself.",

So what you do is you lock the wheels on the cart with them facing inward way from the direction you're going to tilt the cabinet, and then you just tilt the cabinet onto its back and the cart will either fall away or you can hold it. When I say follow it, it'll pop off like that. Now you've got your cabinet on its back and all you have to do to get it ready to play is stand it back up again. Now if you're going to want to have two of these stacked on each other or at least horizontally, this one that I have here has what we call obviously bracket on it and vacillate bracket is the mechanism that we use to attach to the liners. And so this would be the box that you'd want on top. And I'm going to do the same thing here to tilt this box off. I can pretty much do it all from the back, prop the wheels off, stand it back down and line these two up and you see the patterns of the feet interlock. And the locking mechanism is just pockets so that there's not there's not a link that you have to make. But once they're touching each other, you basically just push. Then up they go and then you have a stack, the single person lifting them up like that, and you put your top boxes on top and you ready to do the show? On stacking them. It's pretty much the reverse. There tends to be a little bit of balance lift up on the bottom one. Once it's balanced, you walk around, push inwards, lower down, and now you're ready to put them back on their carts. So for a £180 box, we've done our best. Make them as easy as possible to make them convenient, to utilize even if you're a solo operator and you have to do it by yourself.</p>"

      "content": "BASSBOSS' goal is to provide people with a fantastic musical experience and to facilitate performers in delivering their music in the most impactful way possible. Learn more about the why of BASSBOSS directly from our founder, David Lee, in this video: Hi. Welcome. I am Javier Olivares. I am the VP of Sales at BASSBOSS. And today we're here with David Lee. He is the designer president and co-founder of BASSBOSS. As far as BASSBOSS, as a brand, what is the “why” of BASSBOSS? From the internal point of view, the why is we want to be able to provide people with that intense and fantastic musical experience. And that's why we do what we do. It's so that other people can experience that catharsis and that involvement and enjoy it. And that they can provide that to their well themselves, their clients, the customers, their families, whatever is sort of the the corollary why the why that goes from ours to theirs. So the why that somebody would want to use BASSBOSS is because they want to be able to provide those kinds of experiences and that level of involvement and provide that kind of quality without necessarily having to go through the entire process of learning to be an audio engineer. There's a lot of people out there who marvelously talented in playing instruments or band mixing or deejaying or entertaining and so on. And what we want to do is be is facilitate them to be able to translate their imagination, their vision, their the experience, the emotions to their audience. And so that's that's the the package that we try to put together. How are the BASSBOSS products different from what we can find in the market currently? That's difficult to to to sort of describe. I mean, the philosophy is part of it. It's it's what goes into it. The decisions that are made are almost always going to be decisions that are made towards a product that's going to last a long time, that's going to sound great, that's going to be serviceable. That's going to be something you could theoretically pass on from generation to generation. We build them for that kind of purpose. A lot of stuff on the market will serve other needs, you know, maybe on a lower budget, but it'll it could well end up in a, you know, landfill at some point. Or it could also be that the the market that you're trying to serve is is driven by a larger commercial sort of entity as kind of a commercial purpose. Ours is not really driven that way. Our our products are driven more towards the passionate individual who really has the specific acts of that environment or that show that that that they relate to, they care about. And it's their identity that's on the line and not the fact that somebody else is going to just rent their gear. What benefits will someone receive when they buy a BASSBOSS product? You know, every everybody sort of has slightly different needs in terms of what they need their system to do. But I feel like there's certainly things that everybody doesn't need. They don't need headaches, they don't need hassles. They don't need to work harder than they need. They need to work smarter. They need to not be wasting time and effort and energy and so on and so forth. And they need to not look bad. They need to have the result that they're going after. They need to be able to sort of fulfill their vision of what it is that they're doing. And those are the things that that the products are designed to be able to provide. You're not going to have a headache setting it up. You're not going to hassle you. Not going to have to take twice as many boxes. I mean, you're not trying to be in the furniture moving business. You're trying to play music. So the less hassle that you have to put into the process of doing that, the better. And so when you show up with a smart, looking, clean and tidy system that that's easy to pull together, it takes you less time. It sounds great. You're going to you know, you're going to look like a genius. And and ultimately, it's going to be easier for you. You're going to be able to set up quicker, take down quicker, enjoy your time, or you're not stressed out. Oh, this is getting you just it's stressful enough. You know, you're the center of attention. You're deejaying, you're singing. Whatever it is that you're doing. There's enough stress there. The last thing you need is more stress. When sound system IT components. And so the easier that is and the more well thought that well thought out that is by the company from whom you're buying it. The more peace of mind you have, the easier that the whole gig gets and the you know, the better you feel and the better you look. Who are the BASSBOSS products for there? For people who care more than average, a lot more than average about the quality of the product that they deliver in the entertainment field. Therefore, the deejay and venue owner and festival promoter that wants to promote an esthetic, whether it be their brand or whether it be their the environment that they're trying to create that has this high, high standard that they want to be able to deliver something that is really unforgettable and transcendental. And it's just something that people will have this experience of and will remember for their whole life. And if somebody has sort of that esthetic in mind, if they want to provide those kinds of experiences and they want to focus on the quality of the product that they provide and the quality of the sound in that environment and so on and so forth. Then that's who these things are for. And ultimately the as people get familiar with them, they find it and we find new, new places that we can employ those kinds of philosophies and new products that we build for different folks. So realistically, if you're reproducing music for whatever reason, it's a it's an option for you, but you really have to sort of care inordinately. This isn't for the average person who's just need something to make some noise. How do you feel BASSBOSS empowers people? One of the ways that that we empower people is we free them from some of the concerns that they would have with many other things that they could choose to purchase, not necessarily in the same price range, because some of the stuff obviously is going to add to the cost. But what's what's available from the BASSBOSS line is on the on a sort of a baseline level on a on a rudimentary level is that the products work. They work together and they look after themselves. In other words, they're not fragile. And so when somebody takes a BASSBOSS system to an event, they can do that confidently and and they can do that proudly and they can they can do their show. They can deejay for their party or whatever the thing is. And the audience, what they do will translate to the audience. They're not necessarily going to have problem where, oh, the party's getting really big and now the sound is just going to cut out because the amplifier has done something weird or or you're just don't get it doesn't sound good and people like, you know, they're there. But like I said that you want to draw people in and not push them away. And it's not a it's not a it's not a super low barrier to entry. You have to you have to get there. But when you do, because you care enough about it and you do that, then the payoff, which is the empowerment returns, is that people recognize what you've done. They recognize the quality of the product that you're providing in terms of, you know, the entertainment that you're providing. They recognize the music choices that you're making and they recognize that the event is better, whether it be a corporate event where somebody who otherwise wouldn't know there was something different about it. And then they get explained to that the sound system was different. That was it. Yeah, because so much of sound is unconscious that the people who are providing that are going to get the reinforcement of of knowing first of all that they've, that they've provided something of quality. And second of all, they're going to get the recognition most of the time most of our customers get the response that they get more business from it. They get the positive feedback loop happening because somebody goes, I want you to meet this person, they're doing an event or we're going to do another event next month or whatever it is. I want you to come back. And that's how we empower our customers so that they can enjoy their work or hobby more and that they can succeed with that better and more, more quickly and more effectively.",

And we get asked, what's the right ratio of subs to tops? Now that all depends on the tops themselves and the subs as well, so there's no simple answer to that. But bear in mind that for every octave that you lower your frequency target, you have to increase your effective output by four times. So in general, you should probably plan to have two subs for each top. Two appropriately sized subs to an appropriately sized top, for instance, two 18-inch subs to a 12-inch two-way, two 15-inch subs to a double 12-inch two-way, etc. That gives you the ability to match the output levels that you get from the mid-highs with the output levels that you want from the subs, which is to say people want more than the same level of low frequency. Then they want the tops, so they want more low end. People sometimes say, you know, a preponderance of bass or haystack or something like that where they really want a boost in the low end. And so since you have to create four times the displacement to match sound pressure level one octave down and you want to increase output by, let's say, six dB, that's four times again. So that's 16 times more output to achieve the desired ratio of sound pressure level. And that isn't going to usually be done with one sub and one top.

      "title": "Video | What speakers can I use on a 20 amp circuit?",
      "content": "Join David Lee, the designer behind BASSBOSS, as he introduces 'BASSBOSS Subs and Tops for A 20 Amp Circuit,' a comprehensive overview of different BASSBOSS systems suitable for operation on a 20 amp circuit. Hi there. I'm David Lee from Bassboss, and sometimes you just don't have that much power available. So we're going to answer the question how much system or what systems can you run on a 20 amp or 15 amp circuit if that's all you got? The answer to the question in terms of the Bassboss gear is most of them. But really the amount of power you have available is really related to how much volume you get, how loud you can get, because they'll run up to a point on 120 volts, 20 amps. You're not drawing current from the wall to get the system on. It's related to how loud it gets. The real question that I'm going to answer is, can I turn the system all the way up? What system? All the way up on a single circuit? The amplifiers we use in our subwoofers are intentionally very efficient. They do waste very little power, but they do produce a lot of power. And the power doesn't come from nowhere. So it does have to come out of the wall. So if you have a single circuit available and let's begin by talking about a single what I call a grid circuit, which is a circuit that's coming from the power grid, the commercial grid, not from a little generator. You can run two of our subwoofers and two of our tops on a single 20 amp circuit. You can run them if it's a solid 20 amp circuit. It's not old and weak and it doesn't have 300 feet back to the panel. You can run that much gear at what is effectively full power. The reason you can do that, even though it's theoretically more than the circuit breaker can provide, is because the amplifiers don't draw the demand for power constantly. It's a variable load. So it's peaks, peaks, peaks. And the average is below that maximum 20 amp with music. Even with compressed, produced and turned up music, it's usually not saturated more than about 12% on average. That said, when you have one of those big drops with a long bass note, it will pull the maximum. This is the point at which you can limit out the amplifiers have current limiters. They also have output limiting based on the voltage. If there's voltage sag and it's not getting what it needs, it'll back down. So it'll do its best. The amplifiers will do their best to minimize the likelihood of a circuit breaker tripping, even when you've got them turned up. Whatever combination of subs and tops that you have from Bassboss you can run those on a single 20 amp circuit if you have a double driver sub an SSP218 or a ZV28, you can still run them. But bear in mind they won't be able to get to full power and you might trip the breaker. The advantage and disadvantage in that case is that you will get the same amount, if not, maybe a little bit more absolute sound pressure level output from the double driver subs running on that 20 amp circuit, than from the single driver subs drawing more on that circuit. But they have the capacity, they're closer to the point where if you do turn them up too much, they could trip the breaker. So bear that in mind when you're setting that up and just keep that level down. I mean, one thing you can try that, it's not necessarily going to cause any harm, not to the equipment anyway, is to play as loud as you dare. And if the breaker doesn't trip, then you are pretty much you've got enough to do what you need to do. So that's kind of the rule of thumb in general. I mean, if the breaker trips, you lose sound, it's better to know that before the show starts than it is to be all into it. And then, oh, where the sound go, so test first. If a breaker trips do it far enough ahead of the show that anything that you do during that testing phase isn't going to heat the breaker up because the older breakers in particular, there's some newer ones that don't use heat as much, but bit breakers will trip when they get warmer. So the more you get close to the edge of their capacity and the hotter they get, the closer they are to being tripped. So when they're cold, they will pass more current than when they're hot. And so that's also something bear in mind, if you're out in some hot environment and a circuit breaker sitting in the sun, you won't be able to get as much through it. Most likely if it's a heat sensitive breaker. Hopefully that will help you utilize the systems to their maximum capacity and keep the party rolling. Thanks.",

You can run two of our subwoofers and two of our tops on a single 20 amp circuit. You can run them if it's a solid 20 amp circuit. It's not old and weak and it doesn't have 300 feet back to the panel. You can run that much gear at what is effectively full power. The reason you can do that, even though it's theoretically more than the circuit breaker can provide, is because the amplifiers don't draw the demand for power constantly. It's a variable load. So it's peaks, peaks, peaks. And the average is below that maximum 20 amp with music. Even with compressed, produced and turned up music, it's usually not saturated more than about 12% on average. That said, when you have one of those big drops with a long bass note, it will pull the maximum. This is the point at which you can limit out the amplifiers have current limiters. They also have output limiting based on the voltage. If there's voltage sag and it's not getting what it needs, it'll back down. So it'll do its best. The amplifiers will do their best to minimize the likelihood of a circuit breaker tripping, even when you've got them turned up. Whatever combination of subs and tops that you have from Bassboss you can run those on a single 20 amp circuit if you have a double driver sub an <strong class=\"text-white\">SSP218</strong> or a <strong class=\"text-white\">ZV28</strong>, you can still run them. But bear in mind they won't be able to get to full power and you might trip the breaker. The advantage and disadvantage in that case is that you will get the same amount, if not, maybe a little bit more absolute sound pressure level output from the double driver subs running on that 20 amp circuit, than from the single driver subs drawing more on that circuit. But they have the capacity, they're closer to the point where if you do turn them up too much, they could trip the breaker. So bear that in mind when you're setting that up and just keep that level down. I mean, one thing you can try that, it's not necessarily going to cause any harm, not to the equipment anyway, is to play as loud as you dare. And if the breaker doesn't trip, then you are pretty much you've got enough to do what you need to do. So that's kind of the rule of thumb in general. I mean, if the breaker trips, you lose sound, it's better to know that before the show starts than it is to be all into it. And then, oh, where the sound go, so test first. If a breaker trips do it far enough ahead of the show that anything that you do during that testing phase isn't going to heat the breaker up because the older breakers in particular, there's some newer ones that don't use heat as much, but bit breakers will trip when they get warmer. So the more you get close to the edge of their capacity and the hotter they get, the closer they are to being tripped. So when they're cold, they will pass more current than when they're hot. And so that's also something bear in mind, if you're out in some hot environment and a circuit breaker sitting in the sun, you won't be able to get as much through it. Most likely if it's a heat sensitive breaker. Hopefully that will help you utilize the systems to their maximum capacity and keep the party rolling. Thanks.</p>"

      "content": "For basic setups here is a video where David shows some simple examples: There are so many factors to consider. Without going deeply into the simulations and graphics we will describe a few related issues and some potential solutions that you could actually use. Initially let's consider an outdoor scenario, or at least lets ignore the reflections that occur indoors that would complicate the following discussion. First, there is Proximity. Having the subs in the proximity of the tops allows their outputs to be aligned and summed in phase. This helps with \"punch\" and \"impact\". If you stack subs in the center, you get the benefit of more even coverage of bass but you lose the benefit of that bass being phase-coherent with the tops over a relatively large coverage area. In big systems, when the tops are flown well above the subs, this alignment issue is a problem even when the subs are left and right because they will also be misaligned to a certain extent from front-to-back due to the height offset. Generally with these bigger systems there is enough equipment and therefore enough sources that the gaps get filled in well enough for the audience to get acceptable results in most locations. In smaller systems it can be worse because the tops aren't able to deliver a sufficient portion of the low frequency energy to make the sides sound full when the subs are stacked at a center location. The center-stacking advantage of having even coverage of the bass, without the lobes associated with a left-right placement, is offset by the potential imbalance in the perceived level of bass. With the subs in the center and the tops left and right, the perception can be too much bass in the middle and too little bass on the sides. The 'best' solution is to have at least 3 subwoofer sources. One left, one right and one center. Instead of having one power alley, and several valleys, you will create 3 power alleys. One in the center, between the left and right, one between left and center and one between right and center. Having three sources creates a situation where you're almost never in a location where an absolute null can occur. It puts full-range, high-impact sound on the outer edges so the overall balance is better to the left and right. It puts power alleys where there used to be valleys. It also puts a bit of extra whomp right in front of the stage where the fervent fans tend to gather. Now let's consider the difference between indoor and outdoor. Outdoors you're less likely to have surfaces that reflect sound surrounding your system. There's the ground, but not much else. And if your subs are on the ground, the reflections are not generally destructive. Indoors, the reflections of low frequency sound contribute to the comb-filtering effect. Comb-filtering refers to destructive interference caused by an offset of arrival times. Reflected sound arrives later than direct sound and it, too, can be constructive or destructive. The difference in distance from the source to the listener versus the source to the reflecting surface and back to the listener will determine the frequencies that are reinforced or cancelled. The side walls, the back wall behind the stage or speakers, the far wall and the ceiling will all reflect sound. For the most part, reflected sound indoors will be perceived as an increase in the level of higher frequencies due to their shorter wavelengths. On the other hand, due to the longer wavelengths of low frequencies, the reflected low-frequency sound can create large areas with a perceived absence of bass. Due to these reflection-induced nulls, subwoofer placement indoors is less forgiving than outdoors. For instance, if a subwoofer is placed with its back to a wall, there will be a reflection as the sound leaves the front of the box, wraps around the box and then reflects off the wall. If the same subwoofer is placed with its side to the wall, there is effectively no difference in distance between the source and the reflection, making for a smoother response in the room and a slightly higher level to boot. When you have a null, no amount of level at the source can overcome it. The remaining SPL will always be the same. +1-1=0, +10-10=0, +100-100=0 The only solution is to change the relationship of the direct sound to the reflecting surface. In other words, to move the source,- because that's usually easier than moving the walls and ceiling. A hard-reflecting, solid surface is effectively a secondary sound source presenting the listener with an inverted, delayed, attenuated signal. The delay is the path length difference from direct to reflected sound. The attenuation is the energy loss over the additional distance and the inversion is the result of the reflection. This problem is potentially worse for people with OCD because if you put everything at the same distances from walls and each other, all the positives and all the negatives add up the same. If you offset things slightly you can have one side null at different frequencies from the other, with the result being some less complete nulls and a more even average level. On carts is generally not as good as off carts - unless you're doing the lifting at the end of the night. On a concrete or dirt floor, off the carts will result in a slight, very slight, difference in SPL and impact. The reason is that if the subs can't move back when the cones move forward, more of the energy is transmitted into the air. You can strap multiple subs together with ratchet straps to link their total mass to improve performance. This helps whether they are on carts or not. Other than minimizing heavy lifting, there are circumstances where on a cart is better, such as if you want the carts to isolate the subs from the surface they're on, like a resonant floor or stage. A resonant floor or stage can make the subs sound muddy by contributing its own tonality to the overall sound. For instance, putting the subs on carts with the wheels unlocked and rotated front-rear will allow the boxes to absorb the cone inertia without transmitting as much energy into the floor. Avoid putting subs on any stage that has mics on it unless that stage is poured concrete or packed dirt. The only reason for putting subs on a stage, with no mics, is in a room with a ceiling reflection that's killing your low-end energy. This would tend to be a very low, very rigid ceiling, usually less than 12 feet, such as in a basement. If you elevate subs in a room like that, you will probably get better summed response between the floor and ceiling, where the ears are. This brings to mind the advantages of cardioid deployments. Outdoors, cardioid can keep bass levels down on stage and even keep LF energy from interfering with other performances or even adjacent neighborhoods. Indoors, cardioid deployments can improve frequency response in the audience area by minimizing wrap-around reflections that would otherwise cause destructive interference as they bounced off the back wall and then all around the venue. In conclusion, I would recommend adding one subwoofer for center placement to a 2 subs and 2 tops setup to help even out bass response in most circumstances. Pay close attention to reflection surfaces and try to use them to your advantage if possible. And consider that a certain amount of asymmetry can work in your favor.",

In this insightful Q&A session, conducted by BASSBOSS VP of Sales Javier Olivares, delve into the profound motivations, design philosophy, and groundbreaking advancements that define David Lee's illustrious career. Discover the driving force behind David Lee's entrance into the audio industry – a fervent passion for music coupled with an unwavering commitment to elevate the auditory experience for enthusiasts worldwide. Hi. Welcome. I am Javier Olivares I am the VP of sales at Bassboss. And today we're here with David Lee. He is the designer president and co-founder of Bassboss. Hi. Okay, David, let's talk a little bit about you. Who is David? Can you tell us a little bit about you? I was born in South Africa and my parents were British and moved here in ‘79. My father was an architect and an audio hobbyist. And so I guess I picked up some things from him and I got very deeply into the hobby and pursue it as a career after people sort of recognized what my interest and my level of involvement. And they offered me a job. And so I started working in audio and I've haven't really worked in anything else since about 1984 or something like that. Why did you choose to go into this industry? Why the music experience? As a kid, you know, being an immigrant and not being familiar with the culture, you know, I needed to find my escape because I wasn't, you know, in the in the social cliques and stuff and music was my sort of involvement. That's my escape. And it was, you know, my pleasure, my choice. So I didn't have much in the way of resources, but it, it provided me such a, a wonderful experience, got me hooked on the idea of music as an experience. And as I progressed through that, I found that I could expand upon that. I could provide that for people. That's what I wanted to do. I would say, this is how cool it is. And I was not into drugs or anything like that and I wanted to have those intense experiences. So music was sort of how I could have those more and more intense experiences and making it better and more clear and louder and deeper was how I got there. When you designed your first product, why did you decide to take that first step? I guess it really depends on what we're going to call the first product. The first product that I designed wasn't a mass produced product. It was custom loudspeakers. The early stuff where I started was building custom pieces for specific installations and solving special problems. And the real reason why I started was because I found that the products that we could buy at the time were not a good value. They didn't deliver what I wanted in terms of the sound, the depth and the level that we wanted to achieve and the reliability for the money that they cost. There were some things that granted they were a great value. If you look at the level, the sound pressure level and the price is like, wow, you know, that's that's a great value. But it was never satisfying on a qualitative point of view. And on the other side of that, there were certain things out there that were that's really, you know, qualitatively good, but it was ridiculously expensive. So I think can we can we kind of bring those things together? And at the time I was working in a high end hi fi store that was the first work I did in audio was in high end hi fi and high end hi fi store. Technically, the earliest thing I did was working in a car stereo environment. And so that was like, you know, super intense bass stuff and then the same company in the high end hi fi and home theater market. But that's the stuff I would listen to day in and day out. And then when I went out for entertainment sake, the quality of the sound that I experienced in the concert venues or nightclubs was terrible by comparison to the hi fi. It was louder, but it was terrible. I was like, No, no, no. We need this quality at that level. And that was kind of the genesis of what we were, what I started to try to push towards. What goes into your design decisions? My history has not been one of massive resources, so one of the most important things that I try to do with every product is to make it as dense in terms of what it can provide as possible. I call it ruthless practicality. So when when I go into designing a product, I want to I want to get my best understanding of what result I want to achieve and then filter through every component and every design choice so that every decision that's made is made towards achieving that goal. And every single element of the product has a reason for being the way it is. And realistically, nothing is in there that's wasted. Everything has a reason, everything has a purpose, and everything is intended to make it better and not like not luxury and silly stuff, but just strictly functionally better. What do you enjoy the most about your job? I like pushing the envelope. I like pushing the experience to a new level. Whether that's, you know, creating a sound field that's extremely intense for like 10,000 people. And and they're just screaming and having a great time. And they just will never forget that experience, that creating products that facilitate, that is great developing techniques for that, whether it be management and alignments and tunings and stuff like that, is another thing that I find interesting and challenging and then creating the, you know, designing the pieces understanding all the little nitty gritty details and having not just a deeper understanding, but also a broader understanding of how humans interact with sound and not just the sound itself. I mean, that's a whole acoustics is a very complex subject. But then there's the psychoacoustics and sort of linking all the pieces together. I get a, um, I enjoy sort of connecting those dots and realistically, I really like the process of teaching people that not in sort of a context like this, but in the context of having them experienced that product mix and being able to do what they want. And then there, sort of eyes open. They go, “Wow, okay. So that's the possibilities!” And those kind of things are awesome because people suddenly realize, Oh, they can do so much more than they thought they could. Those kind of things are also a great part of what I get to do. Some people say that David Lee is crazy about bass. Do you agree with that? What does that mean? The thing about bass in any in the audio acoustical kind of world, it's like the final frontier. It's the it's the it's the barrier up up against which we're constantly pushing. It's the biggest wavelength. It's the longest time duration. It's it's the it's the most amount of air that you have to displace and I like to say, reality doesn't have a high pass filter. The deeper you can go. And the more of that that you can provide, the more real you, the more accurately you can sort of create the experience of whatever it is that you're trying to do, whether it's, you know, explosions in a movie or kick drum. You know, there's a huge amount of listening to information that we're filtering out in most of the production that we're doing. And this there's a there's a whole subject on the history of sound reproduction. But essentially pick a frequency. And for every octave that you go down, for every halfing of the of the wavelength, you need to move four times more air to achieve the same sound pressure level. And so, you know, we're pushing 20 hertz at this point and having enough cone area and excursion displacement to be able to produce those levels that those frequencies. That's double what you need at 40. I mean, it's four times what you need at 40. It's like 16 times what you need at 80. So is it crazy? Well, I mean, no, it's just that that's the sort of the demand. And it exists partly because of technology for being able to record and play those notes. And as that technology came into its own, particularly with digital equipment, there was just like, okay, how do you get there? How do you get it? How do you reproduce it? You can do it at low level. You can do it at a level that, you know, you can hear it in headphones or whatever. But take a step way back to the 11th century, and they were making giant pipe organs that would do 16 hertz, you know, foot pedal notes that would just vibrate the building. And it gives people goose bumps because those kinds of low frequencies are not common in nature. Very rare thunderstorms, earthquakes, you know, volcanic eruptions, that kind of thing. These are the kinds of things that bring about those kinds of frequencies. These are not things that you hear on an everyday. Maybe if you're something happens like a giant tree falling down and rumbles and things like that, they bring out your emotions. They really trigger your pituitary and they trigger your adrenaline. And so those are the ways that we can really enhance that musical experience and if you've had the limitation, you know, when sound systems were powered by tubes only an excursion on drivers was in, you know, tiny, tiny distances that they could move to. Now we have the ability to do more and more and more. But who's going to be in front? And I like to be in front. I like to have the ability to do what the cutting edge artists want to do. I want the cutting-edge artists who's pushing the envelope for that low frequency to be able to use our systems to translate that to the audience, because there aren't really any others, and certainly nothing that comes close to the practical approachability and price range that we can do with it. And so that's why I like to be crazy about bass, because the other end is much easier moving that much air, involving that many people and just creating that intensity, being able for somebody to create that music that does that and then translate, that's fun and exciting. And that's as you know, that's the kind of crazy that I don't mind being.",

Whether that's, you know, creating a sound field that's extremely intense for like 10,000 people. And and they're just screaming and having a great time. And they just will never forget that experience, that creating products that facilitate, that is great developing techniques for that, whether it be management and alignments and tunings and stuff like that, is another thing that I find interesting and challenging and then creating the, you know, designing the pieces understanding all the little nitty gritty details and having not just a deeper understanding, but also a broader understanding of how humans interact with sound and not just the sound itself. I mean, that's a whole acoustics is a very complex subject. But then there's the psychoacoustics and sort of linking all the pieces together. I get a, um, I enjoy sort of connecting those dots and realistically, I really like the process of teaching people that not in sort of a context like this, but in the context of having them experienced that product mix and being able to do what they want. And then there, sort of eyes open. They go, “Wow, okay. So that's the possibilities!” And those kind of things are awesome because people suddenly realize, Oh, they can do so much more than they thought they could. Those kind of things are also a great part of what I get to do. Some people say that David Lee is crazy about bass. Do you agree with that? What does that mean? The thing about bass in any in the audio acoustical kind of world, it's like the final frontier. It's the it's the it's the barrier up up against which we're constantly pushing. It's the biggest wavelength. It's the longest time duration. It's it's the it's the most amount of air that you have to displace and I like to say, reality doesn't have a high pass filter. The deeper you can go. And the more of that that you can provide, the more real you, the more accurately you can sort of create the experience of whatever it is that you're trying to do, whether it's, you know, explosions in a movie or kick drum. You know, there's a huge amount of listening to information that we're filtering out in most of the production that we're doing. And this there's a there's a whole subject on the history of sound reproduction. But essentially pick a frequency. And for every octave that you go down, for every halfing of the of the wavelength, you need to move four times more air to achieve the same sound pressure level. And so, you know, we're pushing 20 hertz at this point and having enough cone area and excursion displacement to be able to produce those levels that those frequencies. That's double what you need at 40. I mean, it's four times what you need at 40. It's like 16 times what you need at 80. So is it crazy? Well, I mean, no, it's just that that's the sort of the demand. And it exists partly because of technology for being able to record and play those notes. And as that technology came into its own, particularly with digital equipment, there was just like, okay, how do you get there? How do you get it? How do you reproduce it? You can do it at low level. You can do it at a level that, you know, you can hear it in headphones or whatever. But take a step way back to the 11th century, and they were making giant pipe organs that would do 16 hertz, you know, foot pedal notes that would just vibrate the building. And it gives people goose bumps because those kinds of low frequencies are not common in nature. Very rare thunderstorms, earthquakes, you know, volcanic eruptions, that kind of thing. These are the kinds of things that bring about those kinds of frequencies. These are not things that you hear on an everyday. Maybe if you're something happens like a giant tree falling down and rumbles and things like that, they bring out your emotions. They really trigger your pituitary and they trigger your adrenaline. And so those are the ways that we can really enhance that musical experience and if you've had the limitation, you know, when sound systems were powered by tubes only an excursion on drivers was in, you know, tiny, tiny distances that they could move to. Now we have the ability to do more and more and more. But who's going to be in front? And I like to be in front. I like to have the ability to do what the cutting edge artists want to do. I want the cutting-edge artists who's pushing the envelope for that low frequency to be able to use our systems to translate that to the audience, because there aren't really any others, and certainly nothing that comes close to the practical approachability and price range that we can do with it. And so that's why I like to be crazy about bass, because the other end is much easier moving that much air, involving that many people and just creating that intensity, being able for somebody to create that music that does that and then translate, that's fun and exciting. And that's as you know, that's the kind of crazy that I don't mind being.</p>"

      "content": "David Lee delves into the transformative impact of powerful low frequencies on the listening experience, exploring how deep bass can elevate audience enjoyment and engagement on an emotional level. Part 01: Javier: David, what is deep bass? David: Deep refers to the wavelength. So the longer the wavelength, the deeper the bass. The wavelength is how far it is between peaks of the waves of the sound. And as they get, they get further apart. We perceive the waves is coming less frequently. That's frequency, right? So you have wave, wave, wave, wave versus wave, wave, wave, right? Deep bass is called deep because the waves are further apart. Hi-Fi market, as well as physiological tests, have determined that humans perceive sound from approximately 20 cycles per second to 20,000 cycles per second wave frequency. And so that the lowest that we theoretically can hear is in that sort of 20 hertz range. So deep bass is, you know, 20 to 30, maybe 40, and that's still deep. I mean, relatively speaking, people who hear a note at 40 that still is perceived as pretty deep, but it's not as deep as we want to target. 50 is can also be conceived of or perceived as deep, but it's not as deep as you can go. Javier: Is a deep subwoofer the same thing as a subwoofer that hits really hard? David: The nature of how human beings perceive sound comes into this, and that also comes into the nature of the rise time given the same amplitude, which is to say from peak to, you know, from center to peak versus the wavelength. If you have a center to peak distance of x right versus a center to peak distance of Y, your rise time to that higher frequency is faster. So the pressure change is more rapid. So it feels more like an impact. If the pressure change is more gradual, it doesn't feel as much like an impact. It feels like a breeze more than an impact. So a punchy sound is usually related to a slightly higher frequency than a deep sound. You don't want one necessarily without the other, because if something hits but has no power behind it, has no weight behind it, it's like a slap. It's like pop, but it has no weight behind it. But if something hits like a, you know, very big, like a sumo wrestler hits somebody, there's power behind it. And so if you can provide the impact with the weight behind it, that's the combination that gives you the punch and the depth because there's just not as much air, there's not as much weight, there's not as much heft, you know, just literally volume in that shorter wavelength impact. But when you have that long wavelength with it, it it literally increases the amount of mass and amount of air that's following it. Javier: How does a deep subwoofer impact people on the dance floor? David: So human beings are less and less sensitive to lower and lower frequencies, but we react to them instinctively with greater emotional power. What happens is that as those low frequencies reach us, our bodies respond to our pituitary respond, our adrenals respond. And so it's a more involving and more exciting experience when those low frequencies are involved, because we just biologically react to it differently from the upper frequencies, partly because we are more familiar with those upper frequencies, and so they don't excite us as much. It's like the difference, the change, the unfamiliarity of that deeper experience, that deeper bass experience involves us more. The other thing is that the upper bass frequencies start to enter into where our ears are more sensitive, and so we can tolerate less sound pressure level there comfortably. The very low stuff can be louder without it bothering us, without it reaching a pain threshold everybody's familiar with the most. A lot of people, if you're not into something, look up is the Fletcher Munson curves. They basically show how our ears are more and less sensitive at different frequencies. Now that Fletcher Munson data was done a long time ago and doesn't extend into the super low frequencies because the headphones that they were using didn't go that low. But nevertheless, bunch of experience were done with how sounds are, how different frequencies are perceived as relative to the level, and how as the level increases, our sensitivity to the frequencies shifts as well. So we're less sensitive to some frequencies than others across the entire band. But the louder the sound gets, that relative sensitivity also changes. So when we experience bass, really low bass, it's not causing us discomfort in terms of the threshold of pain kind of thing, but it's really involving our physical, our bodies and it and it elevates the sort of the endonomic system response. Our pituitary and our glands and stuff. We actually react to these frequencies differently because they're unfamiliar. And so when you can actually provide that to an audience, you can you can amplify the experience beyond just making it louder. Javier: Does deep bass make the party more enjoyable for people? Does it make them dance more? David: Anecdotally, yes. The people are more comfortable in the sense that the if it's a multigenerational party, the deep bass isn't hurting people's ears as much, but it is involving them and they feel the sound and they are drawn into that experience. And dancing is a physical activity. Dancing is a tactile experience. It's not just an auditory experience. You're not sitting there listening and with your eyes closed and just zoning out on the music, you're moving to it. And so if the music itself is contributing to that and it's not that you're just hearing it and then converting that into your own movement, I believe that there is a a greater ability for that for for people to be involved or a greater strength for people to be involved and drawn in to that physical experience. If that experience is reaching out to them and pulling them in rather than not. Javier: So is it better to have deep bass than not have deep bass? David: If there's deep bass in your music, then you should be able to play it. If you're not playing music with deep bass in it, then doesn't really matter. But from a point of view of if you want to be the leading edge, if you want to do stuff that your competitors are not going to be able to do, deep bass is that's where it's at. If you're if you're willing to settle for not, then you're just in the masses with everybody else. Part 2: Javier: Is deep bass needed for live music? David: You need to know what you're doing. But if you have instruments that go into those low frequencies... You know, if you ever had the experience where you've been watching a band and you didn't see somebody on stage and they're doing all this stuff and you can see them there, but you can't hear whatever it is that they're doing. Hey, I mean, the mics guy turned them down or something, hadn't turn them off is like he's making all the effort. But I'm not getting the benefit of that and he's not getting better for that or she's not getting the better for that. That's what happens if you don't have the deep bass. Understand that deep bass is in the instrument. It means that it's trying to come out, but the audience isn't getting the benefit of it. So if you have instruments that no electronic keyboards or, you know, keyboard based instruments, that would be like keyboard tubas and stuff like that, they can make the sound really, really big. And so that's that's where that's necessary. Javier: If I don't have a deep subwoofer, does that mean I'm missing out on some of the deep notes that the song might have, but my subwoofer is not able to reproduce? David: Definitely. Yeah, That's exactly what's happening. You'll even hear it if you if you have a song, even a recorded song and you hear this this progression of notes or a roll down or something like that, and it just tapers off if it does and you know that you're not tapering it off deliberately, that's because your speakers aren't doing it. So it really, really is something that happens and I feel like it happens so much with a lot of the mass market products that are out there. I've measured a lot of them. I'm like, there's nothing there. And, you know, we would switch back and forth between one that was brand and brand B, so we'd just turning em on and off and so switch back and forth and it didn't sound like the customer was listening to it, said, That doesn't sound like you're turning one on and then the other one on. It sounds like you're turning one on and then turning it off because it's just nothing coming out of the other box at that frequency. So that's that's exactly what's happening. You're just not getting some of the notes. Javier: So if I buy a BASSBOSS product now, I have a deep subwoofer. Should I go back and listen to all my songs? Because I will experience I will feel and I will hear the song differently. David: Yes, but it's more than that. We've had customers who have bought systems and gone back through massive amounts of stuff and they just call us up and they said we were just sitting there crying and listening to this music. It sounded so good. And you know, the whole system and these are people who've been doing this for a while, you know? So it definitely is something to experience what that low end is. What have you been missing? But it's more than that as well. Javier: How does a deep subwoofer affect the memory of an event that someone attends? David: When people go to an event, they remember moments. You don't remember the whole thing in continuity. You remember moments, peak moments. And of course, not every song has this, you know, deep bass and not the entire even it even the songs that do not the entire song will have it in there. But the reason why people remember things is they remember things that are new. Human beings are sensitive to change. They're sensitive to differences. We don't do experiments. You put something like whether it's your clothes or balance something on your arm. 5 minutes later you won't notice it's there. If you remove it, you'll notice that it's gone. People notice things that are different, so they will notice musical notes and stuff that they've never heard before. And if if this deep bass is outside their normal, everyday experience, that's definitely going to be something that's going to trigger their memory. It's going to trigger the retention of that memory. And so they're going to remember the moments when those when that music is powerfully stimulated them in ways that that's not familiar to them. And so that's going to make them go, wow, new experiences. That's the key. You remember the first time you do something, You remember the first time you had that happen. You from the first time you heard it that way. Those are the kind of things that trigger us to to remember those things. And there's a there's a key to that that has to do with the people who are running the system, whether it's a DJ or the band or whatever, that they manage that process. And that is a whole, you know, instructional thing. But essentially remember that people remember moments. And if you plan your night, whether it's whether you're a band, whether you're a mix engineer, whether you're a deejay, whether you're a, you know, just just controlling the system, You've heard this stuff before in terms of the music. Certainly as a band, you know, you know, you can you can well-practiced bands. They will start a song slowly. They'll all build together and pace and they'll they'll slow it down at the end and it'll have the crescendos and everybody will know where everything is. And they do that as, as a, as a deejay, as a mix engineer, or, you know, in produced music, they tend to saturate it and just have it at a flat level. But that's not the best way for you to create that experience. And at the same time, as a mix engineer, it's not the best way for you to create that memorable experience. You want to realize that it's about the highlights and that's what people remember. Javier: So deep bass is more fun for me. It is, I think so. I think that people generally will tend to find that. I mean, you can enjoy it more, even if it's not really your thing. You can enjoy it more because it's not going to push you away. I like to think that the deeper bass reaches around and these wavelengths are huge, but it kind of reaches around. It moves your clothes, it moves your friends and everybody. You can feel it. You can put your fingers on your chest. You can feel it moving you not just in a sort of a brutal way, in a violent way, which is fun in another way, but it kind of reaches around it and you feel like this experience is everybody in the crowd is having the same one because it's so big and that's what's so cool about it. It it shouldn't seem like it's all about the bass and it's all about the deep bass, but it is one of those things where it gives you that that additional power. I mean, that, that whole octave below thing, it shakes the structure of the building. It moves people's clothes. They feel different. And, you know, you can be a very good DJ and have and create a wonderful environment and wonderful occasion for people. Similarly with anything else in terms of a band or whatever, but but if you want to bring that something extra, if you want to be unique, you want to stand out, you want to be just a cut above or below the other market options, then you know, you got to pick what you're going to, what you're going to do. This is an easy one. You do this, you're going to stand out is people going to notice. And even if they don't necessarily notice, sometimes consciously, they're there. It's like one of the things that there's something there's something there. They may not even know what it is. You'll know a couple of people know you might not know, but that's the mystery. And so them not knowing, they associate that to you, you as the DJ, take the benefit of that. You don't have to explain it. You don't have to tell them, Oh yeah, it's because of my subwoofers. Now that's your magic. You bought that. We gave it to you to do that, you know. Yeah, we, we provided this thing that you then take and then you use and they go, Wow, that deejay was awesome.",

Similarly with anything else in terms of a band or whatever, but but if you want to bring that something extra, if you want to be unique, you want to stand out, you want to be just a cut above or below the other market options, then you know, you got to pick what you're going to, what you're going to do. This is an easy one. You do this, you're going to stand out is people going to notice. And even if they don't necessarily notice, sometimes consciously, they're there. It's like one of the things that there's something there's something there. They may not even know what it is. You'll know a couple of people know you might not know, but that's the mystery. And so them not knowing, they associate that to you, you as the DJ, take the benefit of that. You don't have to explain it. You don't have to tell them, Oh yeah, it's because of my subwoofers. Now that's your magic. You bought that. We gave it to you to do that, you know. Yeah, we, we provided this thing that you then take and then you use and they go, Wow, that deejay was awesome.</p>"

The focus on watts stems from the days when amplifiers and speakers were separate components. Knowing the amplifier's wattage output was crucial to ensure proper matching with the speakers.

The nuances of how loudspeakers utilize power are often overlooked. Speakers have what's known as an impedance curve, which means their resistance to electrical flow varies with frequency. The peak points of this curve will demand very few watts, while the lowest impedance will allow the most current flow and, consequently, the highest wattage demand. This is why the question \"How many watts do you need?\" is akin to asking \"How long is this rubber band?\" The answer depends on how hard you stretch it, and there's a point at which it will break – the absolute maximum. But that's not necessarily where you want to operate the speaker all the time. At BASSBOSS, we believe the true measure of a loudspeaker's performance is its efficiency in delivering the desired sound pressure level (SPL) with the least amount of power consumption.

Take the LS2100P and remove the rat fur/ozite carpet and you get the ES21P. They actually made the specs slightly more conservative in the peak SPL and more exaggerated in the continuous SPL numbers but the amplifier and driver and box are apparently the same. We tested a 2100 a while ago and it provided a measured maximum continuous SPL of 129.5 SPL at 47.5Hz with an 8dB loss by 37Hz and a 7dB loss by 60Hz, so a pretty peaky response. The measurement looked like the amplifier was limiting above 37.5. The output was 20dB below peak at the specified -3dB point of 32Hz. The VS21 will provide more peak SPL than the ES21P and it will do so over a broader range, meaning it will be deeper and louder and will also be punchier and louder. The VS21 is made of 18mm birch instead of 15mm but it still manages to be 22 lbs lighter. The VS21’s amplifier is significantly more efficient than the ES21P’s because it is Class D, meaning it will be less likely to trip breakers.

Which one is less expensive? If all you look at is the box count, as in how many boxes can I buy with X$, the ES21P is less expensive, but, at low frequencies, the price per dB is lower with the VS21. In terms of time for setup saved by carrying half as many boxes to get the depth you want, the VS21 is less expensive. If a box like the LS21P can give you what you want, it’s the right box for you.

      "title": "What are the pros, cons, and theoretical tradeoffs of flown subs?",
      "content": "Q: I'm wondering the pros, cons, and theoretical tradeoffs of flown subs as well as what's possible with BASSBOSS subs. Boundaries and proximity are the relevant points here. Subs on the floor are near the boundary that is the floor. Outdoors, subs can be moved away from that boundary by flying them. The theoretical advantage of subs on the floor is that the boundary that is the floor prevents energy loss into that hemisphere of space. (Hence the term half-space.) The measurement of the output of a source that is taken in open space will measure 6dB higher if the source is against a boundary, ie the floor, than if the source is also in open space. If, on the other hand, the microphone is against a boundary and the source is in open space, the result is that the measurement is effectively in half-space. In other words, it will read 6dB higher than if neither the mic nor the source were against a boundary. Humans are hard to fly, so they are usually on the floor. At the operating frequencies/wavelengths of subwoofers, humans are effectively against that boundary, which puts us in half-space anyway. Whether a subwoofer is against the floor or flown, since the audience is usually on the floor, the difference to the audience is minimal. What does make a difference to the perception is proximity. If someone is hearing subwoofers that are 8 feet away on the floor, the level at that distance will be higher than if the subwoofers were flown 30 feet away. To achieve the same level in the same place would require more SPL from the flown subwoofers, usually requiring more subwoofers. Proximity also contributes to the myth of throw. If subwoofers are downstage center, the distance between the subwoofers and the listener in the front row is a very small compared to the distance from the subwoofers to a listener in the back row. (Perhaps a theoretical 8 feet to a theoretical 128 feet, so a difference of 120 feet.) If the subwoofers are flown, the front row listener may be 30 or more feet from the nearest subwoofer. The back row listener may be a few feet farther from the flown subs but the difference is far less. Let's say that the front-row listener were to experience 120dB at their location about 8 feet from the subs. That would mean the back row listener would likely experience 96dB. But what if the subs were flown? If the front-row listener were to experience the same 120dB at 32 feet from the subs, the back row listener would experience 108dB. Now it would take a lot more output from the subs to achieve 120dB at 32 feet, 18dB more at the source, so the need for more gear becomes evident. The practical take-away here is that flying subwoofers doesn't increase their \"throw\", it decreases the relative difference between the levels at the front and the back of the listening area. Introducing another boundary, such as an infinitely tall and wide wall, would decrease the range of space into which the sound radiates by half again, so 1/4 space. The measured/perceived SPL in that region would increase by 6dB. This does assume that the source is immediately adjacent to the wall and the floor, in other words with no distance for reflections to be generated. If the source is far enough from the boundary for reflections to be generated, the increase is inconsistent at best, and the reflections can be destructive. Add a second wall, (third boundary) and the remaining slice of space is 1/8 of a sphere, aka 1/8th space. If the source is at the intersection of these 3 boundaries, the result is another increase of 6dB in measured/perceived SPL. If the source isn't immediately adjacent to these boundaries, the resulting reflections can cause destructive interference, resulting in little or no perceived increase in SPL. A ceiling is also a boundary, so subs flown near, or not near enough, to a ceiling can seem worse than subs flown outdoors. The reflection from a boundary presents as a polarity-inverted mirror-source. The frequencies at which destructive interference occurs between direct and reflected sound vary with the distance between the source and the boundary. The distance from the source to the boundary influences the time at which the returning signal arrives at a given point, thus whether it is in-phase or out-of-phase with the direct signal. Some energy is lost over the distance traveled to the boundary and the distance returning to the point of reference. The amount of energy lost over that distance, combined with the rigidity of the boundary, influence the amplitude of the reflected energy. In places where the reflected energy is out-of-phase with the direct energy, the level is attenuated. It's also possible for the reflected energy to be in-phase with the direct energy, however it will always be delayed, so while the level may be increased at certain frequencies by the reflected energy, the quality and accuracy of the signal is still compromised. Setting up cardioid subwoofer arrays can help to reduce the number of boundaries contributing reflections, or at least reduce the magnitude of the reflected energy, thus reducing their destructive effects. A second source presents as a polarity-matched mirror source. Everything about arrival time and energy loss over distance is the same as with reflections. Where the distance between the listener and both sources is the same, all will sum positively. When the listener is farther from one source than the other, the difference in distance can be correlated to a wavelength at which destructive interference will occur. Thus the greater the difference in distance, the lower the frequency at which the destructive interference occurs. Keeping the gaps between subwoofers (or arrays of subwoofers) to less than 1/2 wavelength of the highest frequency at which they're being used will help minimize the worst destructive effects. (That's about 7' for BASSBOSS subs.) Now, to answer the really easy questions! The SSP118 and SSP218 are both equipped with fly-points. The VS21 is also equipped with fly-points and shares a dimension (36\") with the MFLA, so they can be flown together using optional linking flying hardware.",

      "title": "What are Watts? Surely there’s a definition of what a Watt is…",
      "content": "Apparently we’re here again… Asking “How many Watts can this amplifier deliver?\" is like asking, “How long is this rubber band?” How can a Peak Watt be different from an RMS Watt? They can’t because it’s not the definition of the Watt that changes. The difference is in the duration, in how long the amplifier can continue to produce/pass a given “power” level. BUT, as usual, that’s NOT the whole story. The reason is that Watts don’t exist. What I mean by that is that Watts are extant only through the passage of time and that they are calculated from other inputs. And when it comes to loudspeakers, those other inputs are constantly in flux... How do you make 100 Watts? You don’t. You can consume 100 Watts, which is to say use 100 Watts, but, unless you’re a generating station, you can’t directly “make” 100 Watts. But let’s say you have need of 100 Watts. How do you get there? There are an infinite number of ways. For simplicity, let’s pick two familiar starting points. First, let’s assume you want to power a “100 Watt” lightbulb. (Ancient history, I know, but these existed before LEDs.) Let’s first consider a 100 Watt lightbulb made for use in a land that provides household supply of 120 Volts AC. The requirement would be for the lamp filament to reach 144 ohms at operating temperature, which is obviously white-hot! Some of the Watts are producing useful, desirable light, some are producing waste heat, but what percentage of the “real Watts” are waste heat and what percentage are useful light are not relevant in the calculation of the Watts the lightbulb is using. It’s using 100 Watts. Some parts of the world operate on household supplies of 240V, and in order to make a 100 Watt lightbulb that operates on 240V, the filament would need to reach 576 ohms at operating temperature. A decidedly different filament needs to be used to achieve the result of a 100 Watt lightbulb. And it’s likely that the relative percentage of the “real Watts” providing useful light compared to waste heat will be slightly different. But this lightbulb is also using 100 Watts. Would you ever consider checking whether the 100 Watt lightbulb you purchased is actually using 100 Watts? Maybe it’s using 110Watts! Wouldn’t that be awesome? Or would it be better if it wasn’t using all 100 Watts? If it was providing the same light as a 100 Watt lightbulb but used only 80 Watts, would that be better or worse? If it did use only 80 Watts and produced the same amount of light, should it be called an 80-Watt lightbulb or a 100 Watt lightbulb or a 100-Watt equivalent lightbulb? How could it be a 100-Watt equivalent lightbulb if it used only 80 Watts? There would have to be something else that could be measured and compared. What would be more relevant to a lightbulb than the number of Watts it uses? How much light it produces? Thats light output, not Watts consumed. After nearly a century of buying lightbulbs by “Watts”, did the realization finally come that the light output is more important and more relevant than the Watts consumed? How did that happen? Someone, somewhere had the realization that referencing how much power something uses, rather than what it provides for that power, doesn’t in any way capture the efficiency or the beneficial value of the product in question. By the way, on average those incandescent lightbulbs use about 15-30 of the 100 Watts producing light and about 70-85 Watts producing heat. So there are some 100 Watt lightbulbs that are more efficient than others. Which one would you buy? OK, so that’s a 100 Watt lightbulb, and those are “real Watts” because they are being consumed constantly. (Well, for as long as the switch is left on, or about 1000 hours on average for a 100 Watt filament lightbulb.) Lightbulbs don’t use “peak Watts”. Or do they? The filament needs to be white-hot for it to reach 144 ohms, but when it’s cold it doesn’t resist the flow of electricity nearly as much. The filament is a resistive wire in a vacuum or inert gas-filled chamber. Its resistance to electrical flow makes it hot. Very hot. The flow of current when power is applied is far greater as the filament heats up than once it reaches operating temperature. The peak current can reach as high as 14X the normal operating current. The good news is that lamp filaments have very little thermal inertia, so they come up to temperature very quickly. (50-500ms depending on the lamp) Nevertheless, the “Peak Watts” demanded by a 100 Watt lamp would approach 1400 Watts, with a peak current exceeding 11.5A. For a 100 Watt lightbulb. And it all happens without anyone taking any notice. Why does nobody notice any of these things? Perhaps because what someone wants from a lightbulb is a room filled with light. You screw it in and turn it on and you don’t have to go to school to have light in your room. The electrical wiring in your house just supplies the peak watts and the RMS Watts without arguing about whether the watts are “real”. If there are things most people don’t know about powering a simple 100 Watt lightbulb, it’s very likely that there’s a lot more that a lot more people don’t know about the infinitely more complex process of amplifying audio signals and then converting them into physical energy for the sake playing music and it’s probably not appropriate to simplify everything involved down to a single metric, never mind a single number.

      "htmlContent": "<p class=\"text-gray-300\">Apparently we’re here again… Asking “How many Watts can this amplifier deliver?\" is like asking, “How long is this rubber band?” How can a Peak Watt be different from an RMS Watt? They can’t because it’s not the definition of the Watt that changes. The difference is in the duration, in how long the amplifier can continue to produce/pass a given “power” level. BUT, as usual, that’s NOT the whole story. The reason is that Watts don’t exist. What I mean by that is that Watts are extant only through the passage of time and that they are calculated from other inputs. And when it comes to loudspeakers, those other inputs are constantly in flux... How do you make 100 Watts? You don’t. You can consume 100 Watts, which is to say use 100 Watts, but, unless you’re a generating station, you can’t directly “make” 100 Watts. But let’s say you have need of 100 Watts. How do you get there? There are an infinite number of ways. For simplicity, let’s pick two familiar starting points. First, let’s assume you want to power a “100 Watt” lightbulb. (Ancient history, I know, but these existed before LEDs.) Let’s first consider a 100 Watt lightbulb made for use in a land that provides household supply of 120 Volts AC. The requirement would be for the lamp filament to reach 144 ohms at operating temperature, which is obviously white-hot! Some of the Watts are producing useful, desirable light, some are producing waste heat, but what percentage of the “real Watts” are waste heat and what percentage are useful light are not relevant in the calculation of the Watts the lightbulb is using. It’s using 100 Watts. Some parts of the world operate on household supplies of 240V, and in order to make a 100 Watt lightbulb that operates on 240V, the filament would need to reach 576 ohms at operating temperature. A decidedly different filament needs to be used to achieve the result of a 100 Watt lightbulb. And it’s likely that the relative percentage of the “real Watts” providing useful light compared to waste heat will be slightly different. But this lightbulb is also using 100 Watts. Would you ever consider checking whether the 100 Watt lightbulb you purchased is actually using 100 Watts? Maybe it’s using 110Watts! Wouldn’t that be awesome? Or would it be better if it wasn’t using all 100 Watts? If it was providing the same light as a 100 Watt lightbulb but used only 80 Watts, would that be better or worse? If it did use only 80 Watts and produced the same amount of light, should it be called an 80-Watt lightbulb or a 100 Watt lightbulb or a 100-Watt equivalent lightbulb? How could it be a 100-Watt equivalent lightbulb if it used only 80 Watts? There would have to be something else that could be measured and compared. What would be more relevant to a lightbulb than the number of Watts it uses? How much light it produces? Thats light output, not Watts consumed. After nearly a century of buying lightbulbs by “Watts”, did the realization finally come that the light output is more important and more relevant than the Watts consumed? How did that happen? Someone, somewhere had the realization that referencing how much power something uses, rather than what it provides for that power, doesn’t in any way capture the efficiency or the beneficial value of the product in question. By the way, on average those incandescent lightbulbs use about 15-30 of the 100 Watts producing light and about 70-85 Watts producing heat. So there are some 100 Watt lightbulbs that are more efficient than others. Which one would you buy? OK, so that’s a 100 Watt lightbulb, and those are “real Watts” because they are being consumed constantly. (Well, for as long as the switch is left on, or about 1000 hours on average for a 100 Watt filament lightbulb.) Lightbulbs don’t use “peak Watts”. Or do they? The filament needs to be white-hot for it to reach 144 ohms, but when it’s cold it doesn’t resist the flow of electricity nearly as much.

      "title": "What music format/bit depth/sample rate should I use with my BASSBOSS speakers?",
      "content": "There are a lot of choices when playing prerecorded audio, but the main ones are: 1. File format (i.e. .wav, .mp3) 2. Bit Depth (i.e. 24 bit) 3. Sample Rate: (i.e. 44.1 kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz) For file formats, its best to use lossless formats, like .wav or .aiff, rather than lossy formats like .mp3. If you have to use .mp3, try to use the highest bit rate (MP3 bit rate is a bit more complicated than sample rate/bit depth due to how the format works). 320kbps is recommended for mp3's, though 256kbps will still sound good. You will likely be able to hear a difference if you use .wav vs .mp3 (with .wav being better), but it's not the kind of thing that will make/break a set. While I try to avoid playing .mp3s when playing on \"big\" systems, there are times this is the only format you can get, and I doubt much (if any) of the audience is paying attention to (or picking up on) a difference if it's a good song. The bigger issue I see are some tracks are mastered with a lowpass filter and you can hear the high frequencies disappear when mixing in/out. There's a tradeoff between file size and quality; when I DJ open format sets for mobile events and clubs, I often use 320kbps .mp3s for file size and availability. If I am DJing a producer set at a club or festival, I will use .wavs. The best case would be to use 32-bit .wav files sampled at 96kHz. With that said, when I DJ, I am fine with 24 bit .wav files sampled at 44.1kHz. Keep in mind you can't \"reincode\" a file from a smaller bit depth or bit rate to a larger one. Most DJ players and mixers like the CDJ3000s, DJM A9 and V10, etc unify all audio processing to a max of 32bit/96kHz, so there's not a huge benefit to going over that. MK3 Series' DSPs are 64bits at 96kHz, so that will match or exceed the specifications on virtually all pro-level DJ gear. Keep in mind a sample rate of 40kHz would correspond to the Nyquist rate for human hearing, so for many, even 96kHz is overkill (though using an anti-aliasing filter and any oversampling could make this beneficial versus 44.1 or even 48kHz). Theoretically even a sample rate of 40kHz could perfectly reconstruct the original signal (assuming it is bandlimited to 20kHz). What I would be more concerned about is quantization noise, as this will always be lossy. 24 bits should be enough to push quantization noise below the range of human hearing. To get the best possible sound from your BASSBOSS speakers, we recommend turning up the output gain of your mixer to push the sent signal far above the noise floor, and use as much of the bit depth of the speaker's DSP as possible. Just because you are playing a 24bit file doesn't mean the DSP in your loudspeaker is using all of those bits, so to best utilize the ADC, give the device a hot signal (without clipping or saturating, of course). Some people have asked us about LUFS, and the target LUFS really depends. When I master, I try to get the LUFS as high as possible without the quality degrading too much, and find the -12 to -14 is a conservative range for that (even though I'd ideally aim for -12 or -14). In this sense, I'd tell producers to mix with their ears and not their eyes. I've had tracks come out around -7LUFS and others closer to -12 or -14LUFS. I think this really depends on the genre you are playing, and in my experience what matters more is consistency across different songs than the absolute number itself. Playing a -14LUFS song right after one at -9LUFS will sound like a huge difference. A lot of EDM is mastered to higher LUFS values (like -9), so I'd recommend producers try and match what songs they will be mixing in/out of, while paying attention to what sounds good. AES recommends -16LUFS, but when it comes to what sounds best on a \"big\" system (without considering radio and streaming), it really does depend. If your range is -9 to -12, that's a good middle range and I wouldn't be concerned if it sounds good to you. At the end of the day, what sounds good is good. My TL;DR advice would be to use a minimum of 24 bit .wav or .aiff at 44.1kHz, and a maximum of 32 bit .wav or .aiff at 96kHz if possible.",

Thinking about getting 10 gauge extensions. Is that necessary? Will 12 gauge work fine too? Things do tend to run hotter when voltage drops. When voltage drops, the demand for current rises. There are standards for cable gauge vs distance, and the further you have to go, the thicker the cable should be. The thicker the cable, the less voltage drop there will be at the end, so your amps will have access to more power and, all other things being equal, the cooler they will run.

It's not as simple as 12 gauge vs 10 gauge because the current demand and the length have to be considered. Voltage drop calculation Ohm's Law is a very basic law for calculating voltage drop: Vdrop = I¬∑R where: I: the current through the wire, measured in amperes R: the resistance of the wires, measured in ohms The resistance of the wires is often measured and given as length-specific resistance, normally in the unit of ohms per kilometer or ohms per 1000 feet. Also, the wire is round-tripped. Therefore, the formula for a single-phase or direct current circuit becomes: Vdrop = 2¬∑I¬∑R¬∑L where: I: the current through the wire R: the length-specific resistance of the wires L: the one-way length But, to shortcut the math, you can look at a chart. To provide 20A at 100' you'll need 8 gauge wire. That's some heavy cable, so the next best thing is to run multiple cables of a lighter gauge and connect less load to each of them. With four subs combined could draw peaks of 40A, so for long runs you should run 4 extension cables of the appropriate gauge for the length. The tops don't draw much but they will suffer the loss caused by the consumption of the subwoofers. Each of the tops can share a circuit with a sub for instance.",

      "title": "What size generator do you recommend for BASSBOSS Products?",
      "content": "Quick Notes Be sure to follow all relevant safety protocols in your area. If you are unsure how to properly operate a generator, hire a qualified electrician We recommend an Inverter Generator because it provides a much more stable power source for the peaks of dynamic music. Subwoofers tend to draw more current (and power) than tops for a variety of reasons. Be sure to distribute your power across allocated circuits (not every outlet is its own circuit) When in doubt, use a power meter on your rig when playing at maximum output to determine the right size generator of all your gear together, like a Kill-A-Watt Meter How Big of a Generator do I need? Minimum-Size Generator: The minimum size generator you need is one that can deliver the nominal current rating of the various loudspeakers you connect (See What is the Power/Current Draw of BASSBOSS MK3 Loudspeakers for information on the nominal current rating for each loudspeaker) We recommend using a generator that provides an overhead of 20% to account for surges and avoid brownouts/voltage sags. For instance, if you wanted to run 2x AT212's and 2x VS21's, you would want to find a generator that could deliver 2*(4.6A) + 2*(4.6A) = 18.4A at 120V. This means at minimum you should choose a generator that can deliver 18.4A * 120V = 2208W reliably. Factoring in a 20% overhead, you should be looking at a generator that can deliver at least 1.2*18.4A = 22.08A at 120V, or 2650W, reliably A Honda EU3000iS, which is rated at 2800W (23.3A), would be up for the job, and could run for almost 7 hours Maximum Output Because generators do not draw from the grid, the voltage of the generator can sag during large transients, causing a brownout This can cause electronic devices like mixers and electronic devices to detect under-voltage conditions and shut off If you want the maximum output from your BASSBOSS loudspeakers, you should use a generator that can provide the total rated power of all of your subwoofers (the power draw of the tops is often negligible in comparison, so as long as you have an equal number of subs and tops (or less tops) calculate the rated power with respect to your subs) See What is the Power/Current Draw of BASSBOSS MK3 Loudspeakers for information on the rated power for each loudspeaker For instance, if you were running 2x AT212's and 2x VS21's, you would want to find a generator that can deliver 2*2500W = 5000W reliably The 2500W power comes from the VS21-MK3 row in the \"Total Rated Power\" column in What is the Power/Current Draw of BASSBOSS MK3 Loudspeakers The Westinghouse iGen8200TFc, which can deliver a rated wattage of 6,600W, would be plenty for this setup See Also: What is the Power and Current Draw of BASSBOSS MK3 Loudspeakers Cadena, Richard.

If you are unsure how to properly operate a generator, hire a qualified electrician We recommend an Inverter Generator because it provides a much more stable power source for the peaks of dynamic music. Subwoofers tend to draw more current (and power) than tops for a variety of reasons. Be sure to distribute your power across allocated circuits (not every outlet is its own circuit) When in doubt, use a power meter on your rig when playing at maximum output to determine the right size generator of all your gear together, like a Kill-A-Watt Meter How Big of a Generator do I need? Minimum-Size Generator: The minimum size generator you need is one that can deliver the nominal current rating of the various loudspeakers you connect (See What is the Power/Current Draw of BASSBOSS <strong class=\"text-white\">MK3</strong> Loudspeakers for information on the nominal current rating for each loudspeaker) We recommend using a generator that provides an overhead of 20% to account for surges and avoid brownouts/voltage sags. For instance, if you wanted to run 2x <strong class=\"text-white\">AT212</strong>'s and 2x <strong class=\"text-white\">VS21</strong>'s, you would want to find a generator that could deliver 2*(4.6A) + 2*(4.6A) = 18.4A at 120V.

      "content": "In addition to being an all-in-one column speaker system, the Sublim8 also doubles as a lighting tower, complete with a PowerCON True1 power output on top of the unit. This was designed to simplify the setup of many production companies and mobile DJs who often bring a truss tower for a moving head in addition to their speakers. This article contains information on types of lighting fixtures that can be placed on top of the Sublim8's tower section. The space for mounting a light on top of the Sublim8 is 9\" x 7.25\" (though technically only the feet need to fit, as the lip on top is small, and most lights with rubber feet would have a base that is above the lip on top). There are also included eyebolts for securing the fixture to the top of the unit, though those can be removed if needed. There is a PowerCON True1 connector that sits towards the back of the top section that was designed to be \"out of the way\" of most lights, but this could cause an issue on certain lights that say, have three feet If using an ADJ Focus Spot 4Z, the light would actually sit sideways (so the connectors are facing the rear of the Sublim8 and the power can go directly into the connector) We are making a solution that attaches to the top of the unit making it easier to mount a light to (that would extend the \"effective size\" of lighting fixture beyond the 9\"x7.25\" rectangle). We were hoping to have those at NAMM to display but the samples were not ready in time. We will have more info on these soon. While there technically isn't a \"weight limit\" for the lighting fixture (since most lights will exert downward pressure), we recommend staying under 50lbs. Most lights that have a single mount point that are under 30lbs, and to be honest a 45lb light may look odd up on the smaller tower, so 30-35lbs is a recommended maximum all things considered.

      "title": "Which Poles and Tripods do you recommend for BASSBOSS Loudspeakers?",
      "content": "While there are a variety of different options for mounting your BASSBOSS Loudspeakers, the vast majority of mobile users place their subs on the ground while putting their tops on a tripod or sub pole. The benefit of this configuration is you get +3-6dB of gain from your subs due to half-space, and your tops can get high enough to avoid being blocked. Low frequencies can diffract around peoples' heads, while higher frequencies can reflect and bounce, so it is important to get your tops high enough so you can get even coverage across the audience. We often find many customers do not have their tops high enough; if they are firing right in the \"face\" of the front audience members, the sound can be blocked for people behind them, causing extreme volume for the front and not enough for the back. To get your tops up in the air to an appropriate level, you can use a sub pole (which uses the sub as a convenient base) or a tripod, which has its own legs. We recommend using sub poles and tripods with the K&M ring lock system, as these have proven to be the most reliable and reduce the speaker wobbling or leaning when up in the air. The K&M ring lock system has a mechanism you can twist, causing the connector to expand and \"lock\" into the pole cup inside of your speaker. This reduces the chance the speaker will tilt or come out of the socket. When you wish to take the speaker off the pole, simply twist the mechanism in the opposite direction to unlock it. Recommended Sub Poles The two sub poles we commonly recommend are the K&M 21366 and K&M 21360. The K&M 21366 is a taller pole that allows adjustable height from 39.5\" to 58.5\" (1,005-1,485mm), with a load capacity of 77lbs. This makes it a great option for pole mounting most of 2-way tops like the DV12, CCM12, DiaMon, and SV9 on top of a single driver sub like a BB15, SSP118, or DJ18S. This is the most popular pole people use due to the adjustable height. The K&M 21360, on the other hand, is a shorter pole that provides a fixed 30\" (750mm) of distance. Like the 21366, it has a 77lb load capacity. This is a great option for mounting a top on one of our double-driver subwoofers in a vertical orientation, as it provides a shorter distance than the K&M 21366. Recommended Tripods: The two tripods we commonly recommend are the K&M 21467 and the K&M 19500 The K&M 21467 is a heavy-duty three-legged tripod with a ring lock mechanism. It can hold up to 110lbs and is height adjustable from 54-85.4in (1370-2170mm). The K&M 19500 is a four-legged tripod which can also hold up to 110lbs of weight. It has an adjustable height from 48.8-76.4in (1240-1940mm), so it is a bit shorter than the 21467, but it has lower-profile legs that can fit into tighter spaces. This does not have a ring-lock mechanism so you can always pair it with an adapter in the next section if you like (though this is not always necessary). Using an Existing Tripod/Sub Pole If you have an existing tripod or sub pole and wish to add the ring-lock mechanism to it, we recommend the K&M 21441 and K&M 19674. The K&M 21441 attaches to a 35mm pole (a sub pole or tripod) and adds the ring-lock mechanism to reduce any lean or wobble when a speaker is placed on the pole. The K&M 19674 also attaches to a 35mm pole and provides the ring-lock mechanism, but it also has an adjustable tilt that allows the speaker to fire from 0° to 15° down. While this adapter is not recommended for the DV12, as the DV12 already features a 4° downtilt built into the box, it works great for a DiaMon, CCM12, or SV9. Using the downtilt adapter can provide a more even coverage front-to-back and reduces reflections from a back wall. Ground Stacking Tops Our larger tops, such as the Krakatoa, AT312, and AT212, are not intended to be pole-mounted with a tripod or sub pole. Rather they are designed to be placed on a stack of subwoofers or flown via the included M10 threaded mounting points. When ground stacking the AT312 and AT212, you can use the 6mm \"shorty\" pole to ensure it does not \"walk\" across the top of your subs.

When ground stacking the <strong class=\"text-white\">AT312</strong> and <strong class=\"text-white\">AT212</strong>, you can use the 6mm \"shorty\" pole to ensure it does not \"walk\" across the top of your subs. <div class=\"mt-4 p-4 bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg\">\n      <p class=\"font-semibold text-bb-orange mb-2\">See Also:</p>\n      <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300\"><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-1 my-2\"><li>Shorty 6\" Poles for mounting tops on subs What should I use to mount my <strong class=\"text-white\">SV9</strong>, <strong class=\"text-white\">DiaMon</strong>, or CCM?

      "title": "Why do I need more subwoofers than tops?",
      "content": "Many customers are surprised to learn we recommend far more subwoofers than tops. This article explains why, and will hopefully shed some light on how our AT212, for instance, can keep up with 8 (or more) of our double 18\" subwoofers. It comes down to a combination of the demands of modern music plus the efficiency of high frequency drivers. The first thing to realize is modern music has most of its signal power in lower frequencies. How much? We can easily calculate this. Several studies have been performed by passing music through a spectrum analyzer, and the results show that most modern music has a downtilt of -4.5dB/Octave. If you were to view your music through a flat spectrum analyzer, you would see something similar to the following track I produced: For this image, we used Voxengo's VST3 plugin called SPAN, a free spectrum analyzer you can load in a DAW like Ableton Live or FL Studio: https://www.voxengo.com/product/span/ The slope of this line is almost exactly -4.5dB/Octave. As a result, most spectrum analyzers used in music production actually build in a +4.5dB/Octave correction by default. This makes it easier for producers to mix their music relative to the usual -4.5dB/Octave curve; a song that is \"flat\" on an analyzer with a +4.5dB/Octave actually has a -4.5dB/Octave downtilt that has become very popular, as it sounds good to most people. Many people are not aware of what this implies, so let's follow the logic. A +3dB increase refers to doubling power. So we can calculate how much more power is present at a lower frequency such as 40Hz versus a higher frequency like 15kHz. The first thing to calculate is how many octaves are between 40Hz and 15kHz (15,000) Hz. Since an octave represents a doubling of frequency, we need to calculate how many times we need to double 40Hz to get 15kHz. This is found by solving . Taking a logarithm of two of both sides, we have . This means there are more than 8 octaves between 40Hz and 15Khz, meaning you have to double 40 more than 8 times to get to 15000 Hz. Now if each octave represents a -4.5dB decrease in volume, this means is >36dB (8.55*4.5dB) more gain at 40Hz than at 15kHz. How much more power is this? Dividing by 3dB, which represents a doubling of power in a logarithmic scale, we have that the power at 40Hz is double the power at 15kHz, or more than twelve times a doubling of power. In other words, the power at 40Hz is times the power at 15Khz. Hence, you'll want more loudspeakers dedicated to frequencies around 40Hz than 15kHz to account for this huge difference, and why we recommend far more subwoofers than tops! Note that these are conservative numbers; if you were to calculate the difference in power between 20Hz and 20kHz (a span of about 10 octaves), you'd find the power at 20Hz is 32768 times the power at 20kHz! Some of our subwoofers, such as the ZV28, are excellent at reproducing frequencies down to the low 20's. The other thing to keep in mind is high frequency drivers, which are often horn loaded, are usually far more efficient than low frequency drivers. A good compression driver, such as the one we use in the AT212, has a sensitivity of 108dB/W. This number increases when it is horn loaded, which is what we do on the AT212 to provide even more efficiency. For a low frequency transducer, you are lucky to get a sensitivity of 98dB/W. The driver we use in the VS21 has a sensitivity of 99dB/Octave. Horns are not an option for these kinds of loudspeakers because to provide loading to 20Hz or 30Hz, you need a horn whose mouth is half the wavelength. Half the wavelength of a sound wave of 30Hz is 19 feet, which is hard to fit on a truck. Hence you need additional low frequency elements to make up for the difference in efficiency/sensitivity between your low and high elements independent of the source material.",

      "content": "If you're curious why some of our subs (like the BB15 and DJ18S) have the option to install rear casters, while most of our other subs have wheel carts, you've come to the right place! Our larger subwoofers have wheel carts for the following reasons: Putting bolts into the cabinet (for where the casters are) can create air leaks, especially if the casters are installed in place of the bolts. Putting casters on the rear of the cabinet involves tipping the cabinet each time one wants to transport it. The SSP118 has a very low center of gravity so it would involve applying quite a bit of torque/lift to flip it on the casters (the DJ18s and BB15 have higher centers of mass/gravity where tipping the cabinet is less difficult. Plus both are lighter cabinets). It simply does not make sense to put casters on the rear of the SSP118 for this reason. This is even more apparent for our double-driver subs that weigh more. Flipping the cabinet can wear the wood/finish on the edge that serves as the fulcrum for tipping. The casters can (and often will) rattle when deeper bass notes are playing when they are attached to the rear of the sub. This is not as much of a concern for the BB15, but the SSP118 gets quite a bit deeper where this can be problematic. If the sub is sitting on the wheel cart (or the wheel cart is removed during operation), this will not be a problem. The wheel carts allow one to transport and position several subs at a time, including entire cardiod stacks of SSP118s. For larger productions this saves setup. load-in, and load-out time. The DJ18S and BB15 cannot stack, while the SSP118 and our dual-driver subs have interlocking feet or sliders that allow for secure vertical stacking. If using the wheel carts during operation, the wheel cart provides a bit of \"lift\" to the speaker so any drinks (or other fluids) on the ground do not touch the cabinet or get into the port as easily. We do try and keep the cost of our carts down; if you purchase subwoofers from other companies, you could be paying more than double the price for a wheel cart. We have seen companies charge over $600 for a single 18\" subwoofer wheel cart. See Also: SSP118 vs DJ18S - Which Is Right for Me?",

Pre-2021 models have button-head screws that require a 3mm Allen key. Later models have socket-head bolts that require a 4mm Allen key. Remove the fasteners. Make sure the Allen wrench is fully inserted into the socket before turning in order to prevent damage to the bolt head. Use the PowerCON connector, provided the other end is NOT connected to an outlet, to apply gentle, steady tension pulling the amp from the cabinet. Set the cabinet on its back, amp toward the floor. Raise one side of the cabinet about 6 inches from the floor and drop it. The shock is insignificant to the cabinet and the amp but potentially more than the adhesive can resist. Use a broomstick to apply pressure from the inside of the cabinet, through a port or access panel. Pressure should be applied only between the power connectors. Place a large, flat screwdriver with the flat side of the blade against the edge of the heat sink. Using the cabinet recess walls as a fulcrum, steady sideways pressure can be applied until the heat sink shifts. Remember, steady sideways pressure. It’s not generally necessary to apply upward pressure and attempting to do is can damage the finish and the wood. This is the most likely option to result in damage - be gentle. If these solutions are not effective, Harbor Freight sells a glass-grabber suction cup that can be used to pull the amp out. Once the amp has been separated from the cabinet, disconnect the red, black, green and white wires from the amplifier and prepare the amplifier for shipment. DO NOT SEND POWER CABLES unless you have been instructed to do so because your issue is specifically related to the power cable. Packaging: Pack the amp into a cardboard box of appropriate size. Wrap the amp in a significant amount of bubble wrap or other protective materials. Make sure the amp cannot move inside the box before shipping.

Is that due to driver selection or DSP limitation ? What dB are your VS21 or DJ118 outputting below 20Hz? Is Dubstep EDM etc mostly 30Hz and above ? Musical genres aren't limited to frequency ranges. Producers make those choices. The vast majority of all music, including those genres, rarely include low frequencies. The lower the frequency, the less often it is present. The lower the note, the more scarce it is. There's more 60 than 50, more 50 than 40, more 40 than 30, more 30 than 20 and there's so little 20 that going to 10 results in almost none. For now. Some genres include deeper notes more often than others. Extremely fast-paced beats such as in psy-trance, don't allow for low-frequency content in the drums although it uses the drums for the energy and impact. Thus the lowest frequencies common in psi-trace are about 55 to 60Hz. Equally fast-paced drum-n-bass uses sustained low tones and creates the rhythms at higher frequencies. Those tones can extend into the low 40s, but not very often into the low 30s. 30s are rare and I find them in glitch-hop and hip-hop/rap. 20s are so rare that I can't even find a pattern. There isn't much content in recorded music or movies below wherever the producer chose to filter it. It used to be filtered at higher frequencies than it is now. The reasons for the filtering are technological/equipment limitations. If you can't record it or reproduce it, you don't even know it's missing. If you can record it but not reproduce it, you filter it out so as not to put the reproduction mechanisms under excess stress. The other side of the equation is, we can't buy mass-produced transducers that operate efficiently in very low frequencies because the lack of demand precludes them being mass-produced. It takes a massive vision and a vast investment to break new ground, or go into the unexplored. You need motivation, commitment and capital.",

      "content": "David Lee shares how to remove BASSBOSS Pre-MK3 Sub Amp. Step by step instructions are below. Subs Amp Removal: There are 12 Allen head screws around the perimeter of the heat sink: Remove the screws with a 3mm Allen wrench. Make sure the Allen wrench is fully inserted into the socket before turning in order to prevent damage to the bolt head. The gasket tape used to seal the amp to the cabinet can over time stick the amp to the cabinet. If the gasket tape has not stuck, the amp will come loose with minimal force after the screws have been removed. The following steps should be used to gently remove the amp from the cabinet: Use the PowerCON connector, provided the other end is NOT connected to an outlet, to apply gentle, steady tension pulling the amp from the cabinet. Set the cabinet on its back, amp toward the floor. Raise one side of the cabinet about 6 inches from the floor and drop it. The shock is insignificant to the cabinet and the amp but potentially more than the adhesive can resist. Use a broomstick to apply pressure from the inside of the cabinet, through a port or access panel. Pressure should be applied only between the power connectors. Place a large, flat screwdriver with the flat side of the blade against the edge of the heat sink. Using the cabinet recess walls as a fulcrum, steady sideways pressure can be applied until the heat sink shifts. Remember, steady sideways pressure. It’s not generally necessary to apply upward pressure and attempting to do is can damage the finish and the wood. This is the most likely option to result in damage - be gentle. If these solutions are not effective, Harbor Freight sells a glass-grabber suction cup that can be used to pull the amp out. Once the amp has been separated from the cabinet, disconnect the red and black wires from the amplifier and prepare the amplifier for shipment. DO NOT SEND POWER CABLES unless you have been instructed to do so because your issue is specifically related to the power cable. Packaging: Pack the amp into a cardboard box of appropriate size. Wrap the amp in a significant amount of bubble wrap or other protective materials. Make sure the amp cannot move inside the box before shipping. Protect your amp from the bumps and thumps of the mailing process!

If all you want is more outlets, there are extension cords with multiple outlets that will do that. Those would be my first choice. If what you want is surge suppression, then you just need to choose one that offers the level of surge suppression you feel is necessary for your location. As rare as it is, your electrical system might get struck by lightning, or you might live in Florida! Most UL-listed surge suppressors also include 15A circuit breakers because they have 15A wall plugs, so be aware of how much you plan to draw through it. Single-driver subs won't draw enough to worry about but double-driver subs or multiple subs could push the limits. If you have two smaller subs, use two surge suppressors. RF filtering is not likely to be necessary so don't pay too much for it. I don't see any reason not to use the one you mentioned but there are better and there are worse and far too many options to choose a \"best\".

It's rarer use scenario, and the lack of a universal digital standard makes it an option we don't feel that customers need or want to pay for, as it adds cost. The AES digital is a single feed with both left and right signals are carried down one signal cable. Therefore each loudspeaker has to be informed as to whether it's left or right, necessitating a control. Not all mixers have AES outs, so it's a feature that most people couldn't use. SPIDF is carried separately left and right but they use a cable that for which there is a practical limit in the length and as far as I know you cannot use it for a pass-through signal. These are just two options – there are other digital options such as Dante, which necessitates IT programming that can lead to trouble and error, and again, adds significantly to the cost due to the Dante IP charges. It would be better sonically to have a straight through digital signal, however that works only if everything is using the same protocols, clock speed, sampling rate, etc., where as analog is universally compatible.

      "title": "I'm using a non-BB top. Can I use filters via external processing with BASSBOSS subs?",
      "content": "Q: I'm using a different brand of top with my BASSBOSS subs, and have 24dB/octave L/R filters set up between mains and subs, crossing over at 90Hz. I typically don’t put vocals, guitars, and other high-frequency instruments into the subs at all, leaving them for just kick, bass, keys, and other low- and full-spectrum instruments. Is this a good idea? All BASSBOSS subs have built-in 24dB/octave high-pass and low-pass filters. Adding another 24db/octave low-pass filter does two things that are relevant to your experience. First, it lowers the signal level at 90Hz arriving at the sub by 6dB, with progressively decreasing reductions below 90Hz, and progressively increasing reductions above 90Hz, all of which reduce the signal level arriving at the sub’s amp. The additional filter also lowers the effective crossover (-6dB) frequency below the range of most of the signal content, which is also below the range at which we humans perceive level effectively. The other significant effect of the additional filter is additional phase shift. If your tops have one 24dB/octave filter and your subs have 2, they will very likely be severely misaligned, leaving you with an even bigger loss of energy in the transition range. When mixing brands of speakers, it’s advisable to measure the combination and correct their alignment to the extent it’s possible. Even when making changes to the settings within the same brand of cabinets, and/or when adding filters ahead of the speaker-specific processing, it’s necessary to perform these tests and make these corrections. This is where BASSBOSS is different. All BASSBOSS cabinets include processing that makes adjacent boxes phase coherent with each other regardless of the model and throughout all the relevant presets. We can’t provide this alignment between our products and other brands, so it’s up to the operator to verify the resulting alignments. In order for us to be able to ensure that all the cabinets align, we cannot allow adjustments to the internal processing that would throw off the alignments. Unfortunately, adding processing ahead of the in-cabinet processing still allows things to become misaligned, but we caution/recommend against doing anything to the signal being sent to the BASSBOSS cabinets. It should be full-range, and the only changes necessary should be changes in relative level to match the lows/highs balance to the tastes of the operator. If, if, if you find it necessary to apply EQ, the EQ should be applied equally to the subs and tops, otherwise the phase-shift introduced by the EQ to the subs will disturb the alignment between the subs and tops. So, to get to the point, always eliminate all low-pass and high-pass filters from the signal being sent to the sub. The processing applied to the tops isn’t relevant to the subs level but you should verify that the tops are phase-coherent with the subs, which is to say you should test them in combination and adjust the settings for the tops until they align with the sub. Q: How can I test and measure the speakers? Testing them in combination means placing them next to each other, equidistant from a measurement mic. Start by measuring the sub’s output response and phase and save that measurement for reference. Then mute the sub and measure the top’s output response and phase. Ideally, use the on-board processing in the top to align the top’s phase response to the sub’s recorded phase response. If the on-board processing doesn’t allow this, use outboard processing as needed. Once the phase traces are aligned, turn the sub back on and measure them in combination. Ideally you should see summation in the overlap region. Adjust (by ear and without looking at measurements) the relative levels of the sub and top to get the balance you like, then re-measure to ensure you have a smooth transition between the sub and top. (If you use just one top for this part of the test, remember you’ll be adding at least another 3, possibly 6dB when you add a second top, so you may need to add that to the drive level for the sub, or subtract it from the top.) Of course this kind of testing requires measurement equipment, software, time, space, work and expertise. The most familiar tools for these tests start with a software like Smaart, but if you have more time than money to spend, it can be done with REW (Room EQ Wizard) or other free or low-cost options like Systune or fuzzmeasure.",

      "content": "The biggest risk in adding another device in your signal chain is signal level clipping. I'll be brief and list the points to watch out for. Do not run line-level signals into microphone-level inputs. A DJ mixer can and will clip a microphone input on a mixing board. Do not use the secondary mixer to increase the signal gain going into your speakers. The maximum output of your DJ controller/mixer is enough to get the speakers to their maximum output capacity. If the system isn't loud enough with the DJ controller turned all the way up, then you need more system, not more signal gain. Don't use your eyes to gauge the sound levels. Your DJ mixer's outputs are VERY unlikely to clip. It's much more likely to clip their inputs, and even more likely to clip the inputs of another mixer to which the DJ mixer is connected. In other words, turn up your DJ mixer until the speakers are as loud as you want them to be, regardless of the indicated level on the DJ mixer. Reducing the indicated level on the DJ mixer by using a secondary device to add more gain is simply providing yourself with a visual illusion. All professional-grade signal-level devices produce effectively the same maximum output level: Nominal +4 dBU, maximum +22 to +24dBU, equating to approximately 12VAC from the signal outputs. More than that would clip the inputs of any line-level device. (Considerably less than that is enough to clip a mic input.) Amp-level clipping can be prevented in the internal processing, so is no longer a cause of driver failures. Signal-level clipping can't be prevented in the amplifier, and so the amplifier does what amplifiers do and it amplifies the clipped signal. This can do the same damage to drivers as amp-level clipping, but the limiters can't prevent it. The best way to add mics to a DJ system is to mix them before going into the DJ mixer and add them to one of the inputs on the DJ board. Some mic mixers even have mic-level outputs, which can be connected to the DJ mixer's mic inputs. In conclusion, if you choose to run an additional mixer between your DJ mixer and your speakers, take very good care not to clip the inputs to that mixer. Be aware that the speakers have a maximum output level that is unchangeable regardless of how much signal is sent to them. Further, keep in mind that the speakers have limiters and that the sound quality deteriorates when the limiters are active. It's best to have the indicators on your mixer tell you whether the system is close to maximum output rather than hiding that information by adding gain at another stage.",

      "title": "How can I combine BASSBOSS subwoofers for maximum impact?",
      "content": "BASSBOSS subs include processing that allows any combination of cabinets to be combined (on the same plane) and their output to sum coherently. This provides an increase of SPL in their common passband. A cabinet that doesn’t contribute energy below a certain frequency will not add SPL below that frequency. Combining boxes that have different output passbands, (or whose settings have been configured to operate in different passbands,) will result in increased SPL only in the range which is common to both sources. ie: The overlap range. To give an example, combining a ZV28 with an SSP118 will result in an increase of SPL capability only in the operating range of the SSP118. Filtering the upper frequencies out of the ZV28 would simply remove the capacity of the ZV28 to add SPL in the upper range. For frequency response purposes, this is effectively the same result as eliminating the SSP118. In other words, you can add the additional low-end without creating an output peak in the upper range by adding the ZV28 and eliminating, or re-purposing, the SSP118. That said, retaining the SSP118 and adding the ZV28 does provide the extended LF response AND additional SPL capacity, and this distributes the thermal and physical stress over more drivers. Thus, combining the boxes and using EQ to reduce the non-linearity in the response would yield a system with flat response AND greater headroom. Greater headroom generally translates to longer service life and reduced distortion. (Not to mention the ability to reach higher dynamic peaks.) The MK3 cabinets with the ControlBASS software provide EQ filters that can be used to smooth out the response. The correct procedure would be to combine the boxes, measure the result, and apply the same EQ filters to both, thus ensuring they remain in phase, with each providing 50% of the resulting output. Reducing the overlap reduces the SPL increase in the overlap range, so flat response is achieved when each element is contributing 50% of the energy at the effective crossover frequency. What’s not often considered is that when a subwoofer (or 3) are providing more SPL than a top, the effective crossover frequency, the point at which each passband is contributing 50% of the energy, moves up in frequency. Thus having both subs and tops with their HPF and LPF filters set to the same frequency, and their output SPL matched, would result in flat response. But, increasing the output of the subs by 6dB will shift the effective crossover frequency, (the frequency at which each is producing 50% of the total energy,) up by ~1/4 octave. If the output of the subs is raised 12dB, the effective crossover frequency moves up by ~1/2 octave. This can result in a less smooth transition between the subs and the top, which can sound boomy or create the impression of a lack of impact, depending on the transition frequency. To reduce this effect, the HPF filter frequency of the subs can be lowered and/or the LPF filter frequency of the top can be raised so that the transition is more gradual. The “crossover” is not the filter frequency, it is the point at which each element is contributing 50% of the energy at the frequency of transition. This is why it’s recommended to try different combinations of filters. Some people run the subs much higher than the tops, some not so much, and everyone has an opinion as to what “boomy” or “thin” sounds like. We can’t predict preferences, and we can’t guarantee everyone has a measurement system and the skills to use it properly, but we can provide ways to achieve the results that anyone wants, without allowing changes that would cause catastrophic gaps in response, and the potential for damage to speakers, caused by phase incoherence.",

This is most likely when not enough level is available from the subwoofer(s). When not enough output is available from the sub(s), using a preset combination with overlap can help provide a little more bass level but it does limit the maximum level of the tops due to the added demand for low-frequencies from the tops.

Connect the computer to the amplifier via an ethernet cable (Cat5 or Cat6 with RJ45 connectors) -OR- Connect the computer via WiFi to a router, and plug the amplifier into the router directly via an ethernet cable. 4. Power on your loudspeaker. 5. Open the ControlBASS application that you installed in Step 1. You will see a window with the BASSBOSS logo. 6. With the amp connected and powered on, wait for the speaker to appear in the Control Center software window. 7. Click the green arrow to the right of the displayed IP address. This will open the Device Window 8. With the Device Window selected, click FILE then select LOAD FACTORY SETTINGS. 9. A warning will appear stating that all the presets in the unit will be updated. Click “OK” 10. Select the file specific to the loudspeaker being updated (most likely in your DOWNLOADS folder) Click “OPEN” 11. The process will start by erasing the old data and then will display numbers of “packets” being loaded. Do not interrupt this process until the “Finished” box appears. 12. When the finished box appears, click \"OK\". 13. Power off the loudspeaker by disconnecting the True1 power cable and wait several seconds. 14. You can then power the speaker back on and confirm all functions of the cabinet. If you plan to update multiple speakers, close and reopen the software between reprogramming cabinets because the new unit will be discovered immediately when the software is opened.

      "htmlContent": "<p class=\"text-gray-300\">To update programming in <strong class=\"text-white\">MK3</strong> models via ControlBASS follow these steps: 1. Download and Install the ControlBASS software You can find download links here: For Mac For PC 2. Download the latest update file (it will have extension .ffi) corresponding to your loudspeaker. You can find the latest update files here. 3. Connect the computer to the amplifier via an ethernet cable (Cat5 or Cat6 with RJ45 connectors) -OR- Connect the computer via WiFi to a router, and plug the amplifier into the router directly via an ethernet cable. 4. Power on your loudspeaker. 5. Open the ControlBASS application that you installed in Step 1. You will see a window with the BASSBOSS logo. 6. With the amp connected and powered on, wait for the speaker to appear in the Control Center software window. 7. Click the green arrow to the right of the displayed IP address. This will open the Device Window 8. With the Device Window selected, click FILE then select LOAD FACTORY SETTINGS. 9. A warning will appear stating that all the presets in the unit will be updated. Click “OK” 10. Select the file specific to the loudspeaker being updated (most likely in your DOWNLOADS folder) Click “OPEN” 11. The process will start by erasing the old data and then will display numbers of “packets” being loaded. Do not interrupt this process until the “Finished” box appears. 12. When the finished box appears, click \"OK\". 13. Power off the loudspeaker by disconnecting the True1 power cable and wait several seconds. 14. You can then power the speaker back on and confirm all functions of the cabinet. If you plan to update multiple speakers, close and reopen the software between reprogramming cabinets because the new unit will be discovered immediately when the software is opened. If you have any questions or difficulties, please let us know! &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;</p>"

      "content": "Unlock the full potential of your sound system with BASSBOSS Founder David Lee as he dives into the crucial world of input sensitivity! Learn how to optimize your speaker setup for top-notch audio quality. What is input sensitivity? What does it mean? And how do you use that information? A system, a loudspeaker, for instance, or an amplifier that has high sensitivity, high input sensitivity means that it doesn't take a lot of input signal to get to maximum output signal. If it has low input sensitivity, it takes more input signal for it to achieve maximum output. And in effect, the way you are adjusting that in the application of using the BASSBOSS speakers or most any other speakers are amplifiers is with the quote unquote gain knob that is on the backs of our cabinets on the front or backs of amplifiers. That really is mostly an input sensitivity control rather than a gain control. But if you think of it this way, when you turn that knob up or down, let's say for instance, you turn it down, when you turn it down, you're decreasing the input sensitivity. What that means is that you're not limiting how loud that speaker will go, you're just requiring more input signal for it to get to maximum output. Turning that knob down will not restrict that speaker from getting to its maximum output. It isn't a limiter. What it will do is it will require more signal to come from the device in front of it, from the mixer or whatever it is that's driving it. And that's an example of how you set up your system so that you're balancing inputs and outputs. It's setting up the gain structure when you know where your maximum is on your mixer, and then you adjust the input sensitivity on the box, you will then match where they reach their maximum capacity together. That is matching the gain structure. The process by which you're doing that is to adjusting the input sensitivity so that when you bring the output up on your mixer, they come up at the relative level that you want. Whether it's like that, like that or like that, they'll move together. That's the nature of how you're using that input sensitivity. Just to clarify for those who think that this is the case, remember that input sensitivity, even if you turn it down to where it's, you know, one or two clicks up, if you have a mixer that will put out enough signal that will allow that box to get to its absolute maximum output with that input sensitivity trim all the way down, it will still go there, it will still reach its maximum output. It's not limiting how loud it will go. It's simply requiring more input signal for it to get to its maximum output.",

      "title": "Why do the Kraken and the Makara have sliders instead of feet?",
      "content": "Q: Why do the Kraken and the Makara cabinets have sliders instead of feet? A: There are a lot of things that need to be considered when designing a cabinet. Feet are required to function beyond what most people tend to consider, but when you’re designing products that are intended to provide decades of service, you have to plan ahead. The Kraken is a heavy cabinet that is hard to lift and so would likely be slid around rather than lifted and carried. Due to its weight, the rubber feet would quite quickly be scraped down to nothing like pencil erasers. Another thing about the rubber feet is, even though they seem pretty hard to the touch, they do compress under weight, which allows stacks of cabinets to rock slightly if the rubber feet are bearing the weight. Since Kraken and Makara are intended to be used to support other cabinets above them, this isn’t all that desirable, either. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is very hard-wearing but also has low-friction characteristics. Sliders made of this material allows the cabinets to be moved more easily on any surface without damaging the surface, including when stacking them on each other, the sliders won’t tear off like a rubber foot could when run into something from the side, and, since it’s harder and has much more surface area, the sliders will last far longer than rubber feet. Since the Makara is a direct descendant of the Kraken, and is intended to stack on the Kraken, and is also quite heavy, it inherited the same UHMWPE sliders. When you’re not doing shows in carpeted venues, we have found that a rubberized mat, the type often seen at restaurant, office and retail entryways, makes a great base on which to stand or stack any speakers. Carpet tiles or off-cut pieces of rubber flooring also work well for this purpose. The benefit of these softer pieces not being attached to the cabinet is that they are easily cleaned and readily replaced through a large number of retail outlets without the need or cost for custom-made parts. (They can also protect your gear while in transit.)",

      "content": "Just curious after hearing your subs recently. Is this accurate? I read it online: Q: Reproducing content much below about 20Hz makes no sense for a number of reasons and is a completely unnecessary and gigantic burden for both drivers and their amps so it actually harms real world sound reproduction. Of course there are zillions of people who don't understand this so there is a great reason to include correction capability for infrasonic content below 20Hz. My counter-quote to that is, \"Reality doesn't have a high-pass filter.\" Beyond that, it's well documented that human perception isn't limited to the conscious. People can learn to \"see\" with their tongues or their backs if an interface device is made to provide consistent, corresponding inputs. It's estimated our brains, aka our unconscious, is aware of 40 million elements in our environment at any given time, and that our consciousness is only aware of up to about 30 specific elements. To ignore the possibility, in fact the reality, that we can perceive things in our environment beyond consciousness, and that those perceptions influence our experience of our reality, is miserably inadequate. It's not easy to produce those very low frequencies, and the ZV28 goest the lowest of any of the BASSBOSS subs. Going below 20 does require a lot of power, a lot of excursion, and can, if done with the same transducers, or insufficient quantities of transducers, compromise the clarity of higher frequencies, but a blanket statement like the one you quoted doesn't take those factors into account. If you don't do it right, it doesn't turn out right. Shocker! To put that another way, it is a burden to reproduce frequencies below 20Hz, but it's also a burden to put up giant video walls and huge, decorative stages. People do those things to enhance the experience of the audience, ie to give them an experience they can't have at home or anywhere else. Essentially to create a sense of awe. None of those elements will create the sense of awe that a 10Hz sine wave would cause, especially because the sine wave would be congruous and in context with the music, not separate from it and involving a different pathway to the brain.",

Remove the grille and the woofer. Using a multi-meter, the resistance can be checked. It should read ~3.5 ohms. If it reads open (I=Infinite load) the coil is bad. A battery (9V is easiest) can be substituted for the multimeter if one isn’t available. You should hear a clicking sound when the battery is placed on the woofer terminals If the woofer makes no noise when the battery terminals are touched to the woofer terminals, the woofer will need to be replaced.

Keeping the amps shaded would be a good idea. Only 2 to 8% of the amp's output is converted to heat, so its cooling requirements are low. If it does get hot enough it will reduce output to prevent overheating. If the heat continues to rise after the level reduction, it will shut down. Fan cooling can be added if that becomes a problem. The air movement generated through the ports helps to cool the amp so I don't expect running it harder will cause it to overheat more. So far we haven't been able to get the amps above barely warm. Ambient heat will affect how well the drivers cool but there's not much to be done about it, other than turning the system down, that will reduce the operating temperature. Amps run 90 to 98% efficient, meaning 2 to 10 percent of the energy is waste heat. Woofers run 1 to 4% efficient, meaning 96 to 99% of the energy going into them is converted to heat, the remainder into sound. Heat is the enemy, more so in the voice coils than in the amps. We have to limit the inbound power to prevent excess heat buildup but ambient temperature will change how long they can be run at maximum output. If the limiters are set for high-temperature conditions, then max levels in cooler temps would be compromised.

      "content": "BASSBOSS loudspeakers contain both active and passive cooling mechanisms. In most cases, the combination of the fans and heatsink works to pull heat from inside the box (generated by the amplifier and driver) to of the box. However in direct sunlight at high temperatures, the heatsink actually works against against the box, causing heat to enter (it essentially becomes endothermic, not exothermic). In these cases, the speaker will run at a lower volume to protect the inside from melting or being damaged until the temperature inside the box drops to a more manageable level. You will see this occurring if the TEMP light on the back of your speaker lights up. If you are having issues with boxes overheating, adding shade over the box will keep it from drawing in heat from the sun. Giving it some time turned off or down will also help keep the temperature down. If you must operate the speaker in direct sunlight, there are a few things you can do to keep it from overheating: Use a fan on the heatsink: A fan blowing across across the heatsink (which is the black metal part the inputs and power are connected to) will help dissipate more heat from inside the box. A Lasko Blower such as this will do the job. Use an ice pack (or ice wrapped in cloth): Gather some ice cubes or an ice pack, wrap them in a cloth, and press this against the heat sink to pull heat out from inside the box.

Cut a notch near the middle of the board on each side then drill 4 holes that line up with the cabinet feet. Remove the foot bolts and, leaving the rubber feet in place, add the board using longer M8 bolts through the feet. The notches will allow the cables to exit at the bottom of the board and the spacing provided by the feet will allow the cables to access the back of the cabinet and allow enough air flow for cooling.

      "htmlContent": "<p class=\"text-gray-300\">In order to prevent access to the amplifier's controls and connectors, there are smaller, simpler and cheaper options than building a box. The simplest, from a customer's perspective, would be to cut a piece of plywood about the size of the back of the cabinet and drill some holes in it. Cut a notch near the middle of the board on each side then drill 4 holes that line up with the cabinet feet. Remove the foot bolts and, leaving the rubber feet in place, add the board using longer M8 bolts through the feet. The notches will allow the cables to exit at the bottom of the board and the spacing provided by the feet will allow the cables to access the back of the cabinet and allow enough air flow for cooling. (Most of the cooling happens inside the cabinet thanks to the air-flow through the ports.) Example below is for the <strong class=\"text-white\">ZV28</strong>:</p>"

      "content": "Overview of the DV12 Stack Bracket The DV12 stack bracket links 2x DV12s in an inverted array (meaning the top box is flipped 180 degrees). This provides a true +6dB increase in SPL, as the waveguides are oriented so they sum coherently (the boxes are inverted so the small wavelengths coming out of the tweeter can couple more effectively, while the longer wavelengths from the woofers can also sum). The stack bracket provides several angles for the top box, which can help to focus the pair of boxes where you want the sound. The DV12 already features an isophasic line array waveguide, and was designed with expandability in mind. The DV12 Stack Bracket is a great way to increase output while maintaining the wide 120 coverage the DV12 is known for. The DV12 Stack Bracket Kit, which can be ordered online from resellers such as Sweetwater (See here) contains 2x plates (one for each side of the cabinets) and 8x M10 Fasteners. Using the DV12 Stack Bracket To use the DV12 Stack Bracket, first remove the 4x M10 bolts from the top of each cabinet (see the locations below) with a 6mm Allen Key. Place the first cabinet into position (on a pole or on a BASSBOSS subwoofer), and place the second cabinet on top, upside down so the horns line up. Attach the two plates (one on each side) to the bottom cabinet using four of the M10 fasteners (two per side) included in the Stack Bracket Kit, using a 6mm Allen Key. The part of the plate that connects to the bottom cabinet is the side with only two holes; the part of the plate that connects to the top cabinet is the side with multiple holes. If desired, tilt the top cabinet down to the desired position, making sure the bolt holes in the top cabinet line up with one of the holes on the plate. Then, attach the top cabinet to each plate using the remaining 4x fasteners (2 per side), making sure the bolts are snug and secure. You are then done!

The reason it's audible from the horn and not from the woofer is because the horn is much more sensitive than the woofer.

These include M20 (threaded) mounts, as well as cups that accept the the K&M ring lock adapters, which is what we recommend. Note that it is important to determine which series of BASSBOSS loudspeaker you have, as the pole cup socket diameter has changed between MK3 and pre-MK3 series loudspeakers. MK3 Pole Cup Replacements If you have a MK3-series BASSBOSS Loudspeaker (See here to find out which one you have), we recommend the following pole cups from K&M, one for a 1 3/8\" or ring lock pole, and one for a M20 threaded pole: If you would to purchase a pole cup that accepts a 1 3/8\" pole or ring lock adapter (recommended), we recommend the K&M 19665-000-55: If you would to purchase a pole cup that accepts an M20 threaded pole, we recommend the K&M 24116-000-55: Pre-MK3 Pole Cup Replacements If you have a pre-MK3 series BASSBOSS Loudspeaker (See here to find out which one you have), the first thing is to determine whether your loudspeaker/current pole cup has three or four bolt holes for the cup. This will determine which replacement you should purchase. Three Hole Replacements: If your pre-MK3 series speaker has a pole cup/bolt hole pattern with 3 holes, there are several pole cup options. If you would like to purchase the pole cup that accepts a 1 3/8\" pole or ring lock adapter (recommended), we recommend the Penn-Elcom M1557: If you would like to purchase the pole cup that accepts an M20 threaded pole, we recommend the Penn-Elcom M1562: Penn-Elcom also makes a hybrid pole cup that accepts either an M20 threaded pole or a 1 3/8\" insert. Note that not all M20 threaded poles will necessarily fit in the hole, and it is unknown if this is compatible with the ring lock adapters. The hybrid adapter is the Penn-Elcom M1557/M20: Four Hole Replacements: If your Pre-MK3 series speaker has a pole cup/bolt hole pattern with 4 holes, there are several two pole cup options: one for a 1 3/8\" or ring lock pole, and one for a M20 threaded pole.

      "content": "To replace the input potentiometer, the field replacement part is the input assembly: INT-IO (This is a circuit board with the RJ45, XLR, button and knob included.) Replacing it requires removing the amp from the cabinet. (Pictures to be added. Video to be shot.) Tools required: 3mm Allen drive or key and T10 Torx (star) screwdriver. Input Assembly Replacement Instructions: The first step is to pull the knob itself off the potentiometer spindle. Pull the knob straight out away from the heat sink. Using a 3mm Allen key, remove the button-head screws that hold the amp to the cabinet. Pull the amp slightly out from the opening and unplug the speaker wires by pressing the release catch on the side of the white housing. After unplugging the speaker wires from the amp and placing it on a soft surface (towel/carpet) unplug the ribbon headers and fan connectors from the DSP. Remove the DSP. Using a Torx T10 driver, remove the 6 screws. The DSP is connected via 2 x 20-pin headers that go from the DSP into the input board at one end of the board. These must not be bent. Carefully lift the DSP out straight, without twisting or bending. Lift the end farthest from the ribbon headers. Do not lift the ribbon-header end, just allow it to come up as the other end comes loose. Lift it from the sides of the board at the end opposite the ribbon headers. Once removed, put the DSP board aside in a safe place. Turn the amp assembly over to remove the input section. Using the Torx T10 driver, remove the screws directly above and below the connectors. (8 screws total) Using the T10 driver, remove the 4 screws nearest to the LEDs. These screws form a rectangle around the input section and hold the airtight cover in place. Once these screws are removed, hold the airtight cover in place and turn the amp over. Lift the airtight cover off the heat sink. From each side, a row of LED tubes should be visible. There are 2 black plastic \"sleeves\" on each LED set. Lift the bottom of the input board, closest to the knobs and XLRs, slightly out of the heat sink. (About 1/8-1/4\" or 2-6mm) then lift the whole assembly up and back to clear the locking tabs on the RJ45 connectors. The LED light tubes should remain in place. Gently push the upper sleeves toward the heat sink about 3mm (1/8\") Insert the new input board by first slipping the locking tabs through the heat sink and then aligning the rest of the knobs and connectors and gently press the board in until all the connectors are flush with the heat sink. Put the plastic airtight cover in place and hold it while turning the assembly over. Install the 8 screws that hold the connectors to the heat sink. (Do not over-tighten.) Do not install the screws for the airtight cover yet. Turn the assembly back over and remove the airtight cover. Slide the guide sleeves on the LED tubs towards the circuit board until they touch. Replace the airtight cover and turn the amp back over to install the screws that hold the airtight cover in place. Turn the amp over again to re-install the DSP. Check that all the DSP pins are straight and aligned. Lower the pins through the openings in the airtight cover and align the pins with the sockets in the input board. Once the pins are aligned and drop into the holes, push the DSP in the last 3mm until the DSP is flush to the airtight cover. Install the 6 screws that secure the DSP to the cover. (Do not over-tighten) Re-connect the ribbon headers to the DSP board. The biggest amp should be connected to the header closest to the middle of the DSP board. If all amps are the same physical size, the ribbons can go into either slot. Re-connect the fan connectors. You are now ready to re-install the amp into the cabinet. Connect the speaker wires to their board headers. They only go on one way, so polarity can't be incorrect. (For 3-way amplifiers, the low-frequency section, using red and black wires, connects to the larger amp module. The mid and high section, using yellow/blue/white/green wires connects to the smaller amp module.) Place the amp into the cabinet opening and start each screw by hand. (Before tightening the screws, this is an opportunity to power on the amp and check it's function, at a low level.) When all screws are partially threaded, proceed to snug all the screws until the crew head makes contact with the heat sink. Begin tightening the screws in an alternating pattern. Tighten sufficiently to seal the heat sink to the cabinet. Do not over-tighten. To re-install the knob, turn the knob spindle shaft all the way clockwise and align the dot on the knob to the -0dB indicator. Press the knob down onto the shaft. Check that the knob turns freely.",

(Do not over-tighten) Re-connect the ribbon headers to the DSP board. The biggest amp should be connected to the header closest to the middle of the DSP board. If all amps are the same physical size, the ribbons can go into either slot. Re-connect the fan connectors. You are now ready to re-install the amp into the cabinet. Connect the speaker wires to their board headers. They only go on one way, so polarity can't be incorrect. (For 3-way amplifiers, the low-frequency section, using red and black wires, connects to the larger amp module. The mid and high section, using yellow/blue/white/green wires connects to the smaller amp module.) Place the amp into the cabinet opening and start each screw by hand. (Before tightening the screws, this is an opportunity to power on the amp and check it's function, at a low level.) When all screws are partially threaded, proceed to snug all the screws until the crew head makes contact with the heat sink. Begin tightening the screws in an alternating pattern. Tighten sufficiently to seal the heat sink to the cabinet. Do not over-tighten. To re-install the knob, turn the knob spindle shaft all the way clockwise and align the dot on the knob to the -0dB indicator. Press the knob down onto the shaft. Check that the knob turns freely.</p>"

SV9 Use DiaMon ceiling mount for hanging/mounting | What to do when flying your BASSBOSS Loudspeaker? BASSBOSS Loudspeakers can be flown with side-pull anchors or shoulder eyebolts, depending on how you wish to fly them: If using side-pull anchors: We recommend replacing the included M10x25mm flat head socket cap screws with M10 x 40-50mm button head socket cap screws to attach the side-pull anchors The benefits of using side-pull anchors is that you can get a cabinet closer to the ceiling, as shoulder eyebolts will stick out above the cabinet. We recommend using side-pull anchors when flying subs near a ceiling and near a rear boundary Side-pull anchors are typically more popular for flying subs If using M10 shoulder eyebolts Replace the included M10x25mm flat head socket cap screws with M10 shoulder eyebolts at the locations in which you want to fly the cabinet We recommend using a shoulder eyebolt if flying the speaker from above or at a slight angle. Shoulder eyebolts are typically more popular for flying tops Use 4 of the included M10 threaded mounting points when flying your BASSBOSS subs and large format tops like the Krakatoa, and at least 2 when flying BASSBOSS tops What NOT to do when flying your BASSBOSS Loudspeaker: Do NOT fly your cabinet from the handles Do NOT drill or screw into cabinets to attach lifting points Do NOT fly cabinets by any other mechanism than the factory installed, internally secured M10 fly points Maintaining your flown product: Check the security/tightness of all load-bearing fasteners regularly.

      "title": "Should I process signals going into my BASSBOSS speakers?",
      "content": "Q: Can I use a DBX Drive Rack, or other signal processing gear in my BASSBOSS signal chain? A: All BASSBOSS subs already have all the processing built in, so they don't need, and should not have, any additional processing added to the signal chain. If you need an external processor to control your non BASSBOSS tops, you could run the signal through a processor BUT without any filters on the outputs to the BASSBOSS sub. That way you could control their level without compromising their response and use the outputs for the tops to do what you need to do to them. (I'd recommend spending the cost of the external processor on a better loudspeaker, though.) Next question is, what do you need to do? And why do you need to do it? The BASSBOSS tops all have the necessary high-pass filters included and are always coherent with any of our subwoofers when used together. When combining different brands of subs and tops, inevitably the challenge is to get the subs and tops coherently in-phase. (That's often also a challenge when combining the same brand of subs and tops, but that's a different discussion...) Bear in mind that just because your filter frequencies match (Eg: 100Hz High-pass and 100Hz Low-pass,) that doesn't mean that the speakers are going to be coherently in-phase. The filter frequencies are only one of a large number of variables that have to be taken into account. A partial list includes: The filter slope, (18, 24, 36, 48dB/octave,) the filter form, (Butterworth, Linkwitz-Riley, etc.,) Equalization filter delay, (not inserted time delay but the filter delay, essentially phase shift that is the result of EQ filters,) the influence of ancillary filters, (such as the subwoofer's high-pass filter,) the processor latency (which is different from one DSP to another and from one sampling rate to another,) and, often forgotten, the inertia of the cone and resonant system as a whole. Combining speakers that haven't had these things factored into the design and processing is not something to undertake without a measurement system and the skills to use it.

      "htmlContent": "<p class=\"font-semibold text-white mt-4\">Q: Can I use a DBX Drive Rack, or other signal processing gear in my BASSBOSS signal chain? A: All BASSBOSS subs already have all the processing built in, so they don't need, and should not have, any additional processing added to the signal chain. If you need an external processor to control your non BASSBOSS tops, you could run the signal through a processor BUT without any filters on the outputs to the BASSBOSS sub. That way you could control their level without compromising their response and use the outputs for the tops to do what you need to do to them. (I'd recommend spending the cost of the external processor on a better loudspeaker, though.) Next question is, what do you need to do? And why do you need to do it? The BASSBOSS tops all have the necessary high-pass filters included and are always coherent with any of our subwoofers when used together. When combining different brands of subs and tops, inevitably the challenge is to get the subs and tops coherently in-phase. (That's often also a challenge when combining the same brand of subs and tops, but that's a different discussion...) Bear in mind that just because your filter frequencies match (Eg: 100Hz High-pass and 100Hz Low-pass,) that doesn't mean that the speakers are going to be coherently in-phase. The filter frequencies are only one of a large number of variables that have to be taken into account. A partial list includes: The filter slope, (18, 24, 36, 48dB/octave,) the filter form, (Butterworth, Linkwitz-Riley, etc.,) Equalization filter delay, (not inserted time delay but the filter delay, essentially phase shift that is the result of EQ filters,) the influence of ancillary filters, (such as the subwoofer's high-pass filter,) the processor latency (which is different from one DSP to another and from one sampling rate to another,) and, often forgotten, the inertia of the cone and resonant system as a whole. Combining speakers that haven't had these things factored into the design and processing is not something to undertake without a measurement system and the skills to use it. Getting it wrong won't make the system completely unusable but it can result in a loss of level, a lack of impact and, in extreme cases, shorter service life for the drivers. Whatever the case, the system almost certainly won't be optimized to the degree that it could be, or in my view, that it should be.

      "title": "Should I use end fire or cardioid?",
      "content": "Q: Should I use end fire or cardioid? Cardioid has better rear rejection, but at the expense of SPL and impact. Since we're almost always looking for max impact, we nearly always aim for end fire. Is this accurate? A: That’s technically accurate, but the difference is both far less and far more in each direction than most people realize. It’s sometimes forgotten that there is SPL loss over distance, even if that distance is short. This is calculated based on the familiar inverse-square law. Most SPL specs and calculations are referenced to a 1 meter distance from the source. One additional meter incurs a 6dB loss relative to the measured output of the nearer source. That doesn’t account for any potential losses due to the obstruction of the waves/reflected energy from the back of the nearer cabinet. You’re not doubling the distance from the audience to the more distant cabinet, but the SPL added by the second cabinet at the reference 1 meter distance is not 6dB. Assuming coherent summation, it’s more like 1dB. And a third cabinet adds even less. If two cabinets are adjacent and effectively equidistant from the audience, they sum for an additional 6dB. Thus, 2 adjacent cabinets each producing 100dB @ 1 meter will provide 106dB at 1 meter from both, or 1 meter from the acoustical center of the two. If those 2 cabinets are not equidistant from the reference point, such that one is 1 meter from that point and the other is 2 meters from that point, and assuming the signal arrival at the reference point is coherent, the summation is as follows: Box 1: 100dB @ 1 meter. Box 2: 100dB @ 1 meter - 6db for the additional meter = 94dB 100db + 94dB (coherent) = ~101dB If the offset is greater than 1 meter, the losses increase. If the SPL that reaches the audience is calculated from the SPL available at 1 meter from the nearest cabinet, there’s little advantage to the end-fire. If you move the cabinets nearer the audience, you can offset these losses. This may be possible in flown arrays, with downward orientation helping, but isn’t a benefit if the array puts the audience at a greater distance. The 2-box end-fire is capable of about 1dB more than a single cabinet and provides a limited amount of rearward rejection. The 2-box cardioid array (1 forward, 1 backward) would tend to deliver about 1dB less SPL to the audience but it offers far more effective rear energy rejection. (Many reasons for that, but that’s a different discussion.) A 3-box cardiod array would deliver at least 2.xdB more SPL to the audience and provide significantly better rearward rejection than a 3-box end-fire. It would also tend to be easier to deploy and take up a lot less audience space on the ground.

      "title": "Video | How should I distribute my equipment load on a 20 Amp Circuit?",
      "content": "In this presentation, David Lee, the designer at BASSBOSS, offers insights into optimizing system load distribution to maximize the utilization of available power resources. Hello. I'm David Lee from BASSBOSS. And we've been asked, what's the best practice for load distribution when hooking up a sound system? In general, you're going to have things that draw a lot of power, things that draw less, and things that draw virtually nothing. From a power consumption perspective, subwoofers, and particularly subwoofer amplifiers, tend to draw the most power. The next most power is drawn by the middle and high cabinets, and things that draw virtually nothing are your mixers, control devices, CD players, and so on. The key to distributing your load is to put some of each type of device on each circuit. This way, you avoid having all the subs on one circuit and all the mids on another, or having two subwoofers and your mixer on one circuit and the mids on another. If the subwoofers overdraw one circuit, then the mixer may go down. Generally, you want to distribute the load so that it's ideally balanced. Up to about 2,000-2,500 watts is about the maximum continuous draw you can get on a 20-amp circuit. However, amplifiers are dynamic draw devices—they don’t draw a constant current like a light bulb or fan. Instead, they pull current in peaks, at voltage spikes, and specifically at impedance minimums. This means that the average current draw is significantly lower than the peak draw. A bass hit in music, which often coincides with a snare hit, means that the subwoofer and the tops draw from the circuit at different moments. Mixers, processors, CD players, computers, and laptops have a constant but very low draw that won't significantly impact the circuit breaker. For BASSBOSS products, our amplifiers are very efficient, ranging from 92% to 98% efficiency, which varies with level and frequency. In contrast, less efficient amplifiers, like those with toroidal transformers or non-switch mode designs, waste about 30% of power, making them 70% efficient. This waste is a constant draw, unlike the fluctuating draw of switch mode amplifiers. Generally speaking, you can put roughly two amplifiers on a 20-amp circuit, depending on the content and load. When you add a mid-high cabinet, ensure it’s on the same circuit so that the bass and tops draw power at different times, avoiding simultaneous heavy draw. Mid-high cabinets draw significantly less power, so they won’t stress the breaker if not used simultaneously with the subs. If you have three circuits, you might use one for each side and one for the center. Assign the subs to one or two circuits and place your mids, highs, and mixing boards on the third circuit. This way, if a sub trips a breaker, you won’t lose all sound—just one or two subs. Additionally, if you can determine which phase a circuit is on (X leg, Y leg, or Z leg in three-phase systems), try to balance the load across the phases. Don’t overload one leg with all the heavy stuff. For example, distribute the subs and other gear evenly across the X, Y, and Z legs to balance the draw. Hopefully, this advice helps you manage your circuits effectively and keeps the music playing smoothly. Thanks a lot.",

A bass hit in music, which often coincides with a snare hit, means that the subwoofer and the tops draw from the circuit at different moments. Mixers, processors, CD players, computers, and laptops have a constant but very low draw that won't significantly impact the circuit breaker. For BASSBOSS products, our amplifiers are very efficient, ranging from 92% to 98% efficiency, which varies with level and frequency. In contrast, less efficient amplifiers, like those with toroidal transformers or non-switch mode designs, waste about 30% of power, making them 70% efficient. This waste is a constant draw, unlike the fluctuating draw of switch mode amplifiers. Generally speaking, you can put roughly two amplifiers on a 20-amp circuit, depending on the content and load. When you add a mid-high cabinet, ensure it’s on the same circuit so that the bass and tops draw power at different times, avoiding simultaneous heavy draw. Mid-high cabinets draw significantly less power, so they won’t stress the breaker if not used simultaneously with the subs. If you have three circuits, you might use one for each side and one for the center. Assign the subs to one or two circuits and place your mids, highs, and mixing boards on the third circuit. This way, if a sub trips a breaker, you won’t lose all sound—just one or two subs. Additionally, if you can determine which phase a circuit is on (X leg, Y leg, or Z leg in three-phase systems), try to balance the load across the phases. Don’t overload one leg with all the heavy stuff. For example, distribute the subs and other gear evenly across the X, Y, and Z legs to balance the draw. Hopefully, this advice helps you manage your circuits effectively and keeps the music playing smoothly. Thanks a lot.</p>"

Driver test video (first minute shows the battery test) Tools required are a Philips screwdriver and a 4mm Allen wrench to remove the grille and the woofer. Remove the grille and the woofer.

Dive into the world of sound engineering as we explore the significance of understanding input sensitivity in speakers. Discover why mastering input sensitivity is crucial for optimizing your audio equipment's performance. The secrets behind using input sensitivity to unlock the full potential of your loudspeakers and achieve unparalleled sound quality. What is input sensitivity? What does it mean? And how do you use that information? A system, a loudspeaker, for instance, or an amplifier that has high sensitivity, high input sensitivity means that it doesn't take a lot of input signal to get to maximum output signal. If it has low input sensitivity, it takes more input signal for it to achieve maximum output. And in effect, the way you are adjusting that in the application of using the BASSBOSS speakers or most any other speakers or amplifiers is with the quote unquote gain knob that is on the backs of our cabinets on the front or backs of amplifiers. That really is mostly an input sensitivity control rather than a gain control. But if you think of it this way, when you turn that knob up or down, let's say for instance, you turn it down, when you turn it down, you're decreasing the input sensitivity. What that means is that you're not limiting how loud that speaker will go, you're just requiring more input signal for it to get to maximum output. Turning that knob down will not restrict that speaker from getting to its maximum output. It isn't a limiter. What it will do is it will require more signal to come from the device in front of it, from the mixer or whatever it is that's driving it. And that's an example of how you set up your system so that you're balancing inputs and outputs. It's setting up the gain structure when you know where your maximum is on your mixer, and then you adjust the input sensitivity on the box, you will then match where they reach their maximum capacity together. That is matching the gain structure. The process by which you're doing that is adjusting the input sensitivity so that when you bring the output up on your mixer, they come up at the relative level that you want. Whether it's like that, like that or like that, they'll move together. That's the nature of how you're using that input sensitivity. Just to clarify for those who think that this is the case, remember that input sensitivity, even if you turn it down to where it's, you know, one or two clicks up, if you have a mixer that will put out enough signal that will allow that box to get to its absolute maximum output with that input sensitivity trim all the way down, it will still go there, it will still reach its maximum output. It's not limiting how loud it will go. It's simply requiring more input signal for it to get to its maximum output.",

      "content": "Q: Why doesn't BASSBOSS use foam on your grilles? A: We've found over many years that foam introduces more problems than it alleviates, so we do not use it for the following reasons: Foam on the grille causes noise when the cabinet is used at high output. With the amount of air flow these cabinets can generate, the foam in front of the ports gets shredded quickly. Foam always deteriorates and looks ratty long before steel, wood and drivers do, so products without foam look tidy for much longer. Foam captures dust in front of the ports and drivers, making the cabinet look dirty and requiring more cleaning. There has never been a case of drivers failing due to debris entering via the grille holes. We prioritize sound quality and performance over the intrusion of dust. :) BASSBOSS products are intended to be used for decades. All the components are chosen for their performance and long term reliability. Foam doesn't fit the bill for this long-term goal.",

A: We've found over many years that foam introduces more problems than it alleviates, so we do not use it for the following reasons: Foam on the grille causes noise when the cabinet is used at high output. With the amount of air flow these cabinets can generate, the foam in front of the ports gets shredded quickly. Foam always deteriorates and looks ratty long before steel, wood and drivers do, so products without foam look tidy for much longer. Foam captures dust in front of the ports and drivers, making the cabinet look dirty and requiring more cleaning. There has never been a case of drivers failing due to debris entering via the grille holes. We prioritize sound quality and performance over the intrusion of dust. :) BASSBOSS products are intended to be used for decades. All the components are chosen for their performance and long term reliability. Foam doesn't fit the bill for this long-term goal.</p>"

A: The SSP218 cabinet has been in production since 2008, and was designed for large scale production work. There were design decisions that were made that precluded the use feet on the side. The addition of feet on the ends would make the cabinet less stable when standing on end because, due to the location of the baffle, the feet cannot be at the very front of the cabinet. In addition, the feet can’t be at the edges either, making the footprint even smaller.

The background on the specs for the DiaMon is that although the peak output was very high, it's sustained output was limited by the DSP to prevent excess heat build-up in the coil. This is why the peak output and the sustained output are more than the standard 3dB apart. It can do that peak output, but it can't sustain that output long-term safely. In order to provide customers with realistic expectations, we rated it at the limited SPL for sustained output. The key is not to have the cabinet running into the limiter all the time.

The subs can either be placed together in the middle of the room for maximum impact, or they can be spaced out to the sides provide a solid base for your tops. This guide applies whether you are using two single driver subs (like an SSP118 or VS21) or two double driver subs (like a ZV28 or Makara). While you will get the best acoustic performance locating all your subwoofers together (ratchet-strapping them to one another will further allow them to work together acoustically), it is more common to space your subs out to avoid needing speaker tripods for your tops. A BASSBOSS subwoofer works as a solid base to secure a top via a speaker pole, and cannot be tripped or knocked over as easily. With left-right subs, you also can get a more consistent SPL across the frontal plane of the audience, at the expense of cancellations at some frequencies depending on the spacing between the subs. The wiring guide below shows our recommended way of wiring two tops and subs together. Notes: If you are using two double-driver subs, you should place each sub on it's own circuit to avoid tripping a breaker! 1 Sub, 2 Tops: While we recommend having more subwoofers than tops due to the demands of modern music (you can read more about this here), there are times when space, transportation, or power constraints necessitate using a single subwoofer with two tops. The wiring guide below applies for using a single or double driver subwoofer with two BASSBOSS tops: Notes: It does not matter whether you wire the sub on the left or right. It makes more sense to place your sub in a corner, if possible. We recommend keeping both of your tops on the same preset to avoid phase cancellations with your subwoofer. You will likely need to turn your tops down (using the gain knob on the rear of the box) to achieve a good balance when using only one subwoofer.

      "content": "The base output latency for the MK3 series speakers is 0.466ms, which is due to the DSP. However what people often want to know is what the overall output latency is that includes the filters and physical construction of the box. It is impossible to answer this question with a single number because the overall response is frequency dependent (filtering will always involves phase changes, and will almost always introduce phase changes that vary based on frequency). When this question is asked, it is usually so a customer can align their BASSBOSS subs with subs or tops from another manufacturer. Wo not recommend attempting to align BASSBOSS subs to any other subs using just delay, as this will inevitably align some frequencies and cause cancellations at others. Without taking a measurement, it is virtually impossible to give an easy answer because the implementations of the filter algorithms likely will differ between BASSBOSS loudspeakers and any other manufacturer's loudspeakers, let alone the way the physical construction of the box affects the resulting phase. Rather, one should take a measurement and then use the tools at their disposal to choose settings that suit one's application and purpose. Programs that can help with this are SMAART and REW (Room EQ Wizard), the latter of which is free. Here, allpass filters can be a good option for aligning the phase trances of each box, but not everyone has gear that can implement this. A measurement mic isn't necessary because what matters is the relative phase between different boxes, so a simple vocal mic will do. We've seen customers have good success when taking the time to do this. We've spent a lot of time making sure all BASSBOSS subs are phase and time aligned with one another across the spectrum. However, when it comes to how this alignment interacts with boxes from other manufacturers it can be a real wildcard. In our experience, pairing BASSBOSS speakers with loudspeakers from another company can create more problems than it solves, unless one is willing to take measurements. In the future, we may offer a service where we measure and create presets for different boxes, especially those that are highly requested.

Arraying a pair of speakers ordinarily results in an increase of 6dB if their output is coherent, which an array of DV12s, an array of MFLAs and an array of most subs would be. An array of 2 \"point-source\" speakers (such as AT212s, DiaMons, AT312s and most other non-line-array speakers in the world) would result in a 6dB increase at low frequencies, where the output would be coherent, and an increase of only 3dB where their output would tend to be incoherent, in other words, where their outputs would begin interfering with each other. (aka comb-filtering.) The woofers in the MFLA are more efficient than the woofers in the DV12, so they can sustain a higher SPL. Two DV12s would get you to 132dB. (The low-frequency drivers are usually the limiting factor in the output SPL, which is why some manufacturers claim such high SPL capabilities for their line-arrays and tops: They measure the maximum SPL that the tweeter can provide, or at 1kHz, where both woofers and tweeters are contributing, without considering that if the woofer(s) can't keep up at the bottom end, the sound character changes and the result doesn't sound good at all.)",

      "content": "If you have only one sub it should always be used in Normal mode. In Normal mode, the sub is phase-coherent with the tops when they are facing the same way. When you add the second sub that's necessary for cardioid mode it does face the rear and it does go in Cardioid mode. The forward-facing sub remains in Normal mode. The output of the rearward-firing subwoofer in Cardioid mode is used to cancel the wrap-around energy coming from the Normally positioned, Normal-mode sub. When it's in Cardioid mode, the forward output of the subwoofer is not phase-coherent with the tops, so if you put the sub in its normal, forward-firing position and switch it to Cardioid mode there will be a significant gap in their combined response.
